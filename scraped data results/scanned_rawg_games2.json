It takes place in the fictional Empire inspired by the XIX-century England. The plot picks up where Dishonored 2 left it. The game follows the adventures of the previous games&#39; villains: Billie Lurk, the captain of a sailing ship, and Daud, the assassin and the leader of The Whalers gang. They search for Outsider, an extradimensional creature from the world known as the Void who can give people supernatural abilities, and are going to kill him. Their story is intertwined with the larger events in the Empire, such as the reinstallment of the Empress, the faction rivalry and the Void influence on the world. The plot is non-linear and features multiple endings.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Billie Lurk from the first person view. Like its predecessors, Death of the Outsider emphasizes stealth and surprise attacks. Billie wields a dagger and eventually receives superhuman powers, such as teleportation and disguise. The expansion allows the unusually free use of these abilities. The player doesn&#39;t have to unlock them, they become available early at the game, and the energy they require regenerates automatically over time. Besides the main plot, the player can also accept side quests.</p>"

The story of Darksiders III unfolds at the background of the events of two original games. Darksiders III follows Fury, a Horsewoman of the Apocalypse and the sister to the original protagonist, War the Horseman. She goes on a quest given to her by the Charred Council, an institution that is meant to keep the balance between Heaven, Hell, and Earth. Fury&#39;s mission is to find and annihilate the infamous Seven Deadly Sins. The mighty Lord of the Hollows agrees to help her, although he&#39;s obviously pursuing his own goals. He gives Fury the power of the flame.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Fury from the third person view in an open world. She can use a variety of weapons, including a whip, a sword, and a dagger, as well as her magical abilities. She can also shape-shift into several forms based on elements, such as the flame. Fury also has to solve puzzles and jump platforms. The game reintroduces some of the enemies from the previous parts and introduces new monsters. The enemies in Darksiders III are less numerous but stronger and tougher, taking more effort to beat them.</p>"

        "description": "<p>MIND CONTROL DELETE is a standalone expansion set in the SUPERHOT universe. It\u2019s designed as a rogue-like twist on the linear nature of the original SUPERHOT. In it\u2019s well proven genre-defining format, SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE distills and expands on the same intoxicating rhythm of slow motion combat.<br />\nThe game will force you through dozens of increasingly difficult time-moves-only-when-you-move gameplay challenges. Each challenge will make you more powerful and bring you closer to deciphering the secrets hidden from you by the system. As you unlock powerful abilities and gain access to new playable characters, so will your enemies grow stronger, smarter and more desperate to stop you.<br />\nCome and join the fray. Play in Early Access. Let the system learn from you.SUPERHOT rogue-like expansion early access hype! What to expect now?<br />\nWe\u2019re still a good 9-12 months away from a full release, so please don\u2019t forget that this is nowhere close to a complete, satisfying experience just yet. The current build of MIND CONTROL DELETE is the first time we\u2019re inviting you to check out a few of the brand new gameplay systems that are going to be central to the game:<br />\nFirst 2 playable MINDS, each with it\u2019s own unique ability and gameplay modifiers<br />\nA kaleidoscope of the first dozen new gameplay levels that mix into the first few dozen combat challenges<br />\nNew animation and AI systems to drive new weapons, abilities, and enemy types<br />\nHitpoint system and power-up store to give you that extra oompf needed to crush your enemies and see them driven before you<br />\nProcedural rogue-like run generation baked into the core gameplay loop, enabling us to tell longer, more complex stories and deliver tons more of satisfying skill-based gameplay<br />\nBeware though - this is an extremely early, bleeding-edge version of most of those systems. The limitations for this early access build are not for the faint of heart:<br />\nNo story whatsoever - we don\u2019t want to spoil too much too quickly so this and the next few updates will be all about gameplay features<br />\nNo advanced power-ups or new enemy types enabled yet - we want to establish and test the balance of vanilla gameplay in this build, waiting to sprinkle in gamebreaking modifiers and new foes to beat up until future updates<br />\nNo replay or point system - easy bragging about your insane skills will need to wait<br />\nAbsolutely no hidden menu minigames yet - we have so many new cool ones coming out super soon tho &lt;3<br />\nIf you\u2019re not looking for an incomplete game that\u2019s in constant flux and relies on your feedback and creativity to expand, or if you\u2019d rather just play a finished experience that\u2019s guaranteed to challenge and satisfy you and your deepest power fantasies, then we totally recommend you should wait until MIND CONTROL DELETE is out of early access.<br />\nHowever, if you\u2019re super brave and want to help guide the development in its earliest stages, then go ahead - join us, and get your name in the credits!Why are you putting MIND CONTROL DELETE in early access in the first place tho?<br />\nWe released the original SUPERHOT in February 2016 after nearly two years of intense creative crunch. The amazing support during the development from our Kickstarter backers and the exhilarating reaction we got from you once the game released was simply mind blowing.<br />\nWith morale at an all-time high, we immediately jumped into a flurry of prototyping and refining gameplay and story concepts that we weren\u2019t able to fit into the original game. We tested and put a bunch of them to work in virtual reality, and after releasing SUPERHOT VR to even more outstanding support from you guys, we finally had a road map for the first non-VR expansion ironed out in December 2016. In our usual no-compromise approach to design, we made that roadmap way more ambitious than originally anticipated and we decided to make the expansion a fully standalone game, allowing us to rewrite and reimagine all of our major gameplay systems.<br />\nThe single most important strength of the original SUPERHOT was the amazing involvement of tens of thousands of creative alpha and beta testers that helped us shape and balance the game and drove us to pursue zero compromises in design. After over a year of work on MIND CONTROL DELETE, we\u2019re now ready to start this adventure together again. We\u2019re inviting you to jump in and co-create the game with us. Talk to us, work with us, and let\u2019s build the build the biggest SUPERHOT yet together.What\u2019s the price tag on this? Is this that free DLC you were talking about?<br />\nYup! Way bigger than the usual free DLC though, so it&#39;ll take a bit longer to release. If you own the original SUPERHOT on Steam now or buy it while MIND CONTROL DELETE is still in Early Access, you\u2019ll get the full expansion for free once it\u2019s finished and released.<br />\nHowever if you can\u2019t wait to work with us, and you feel like bravely facing rough edges and helping shape the game as it develops, then we\u2019ll be thrilled to have you sign your name to a piece of SUPERHOT history and join us in Early Access right now.<br />\nOnce MIND CONTROL DELETE releases in earnest, it will be priced same as the other SUPERHOT games for everyone who\u2019s still new to the franchise.FAQ<br />\nShould I buy MIND CONTROL DELETE if I haven\u2019t played the original SUPERHOT?<br />\nNot right now. The game will be a totally standalone experience in a few updates, but the lack of clear structure and story right now would be confusing for newcomers. Definitely get the original SUPERHOT though. It\u2019s lots of fun.<br />\nWhat\u2019s the update roadmap?<br />\nWe\u2019re new to Early Access, but we\u2019re hoping to use your feedback and collaboration to drive and guide the development. We have a bunch of large features already in the pipeline that we\u2019ll be dropping on livestream updates every few weeks, starting with the first major content update dropping in January, and following with balance and feature updates released on a monthly / bi-monthly schedule.<br />\nI really want X in the game, how do I make you want to do X too?<br />\nThe discussions around the game are taking place on Steam Community, Discord and Reddit groups. Join us, make yourself heard, and rally up your fellow players. We\u2019ll tap into your creative hivemind. We\u2019ll put your ideas into life.<br />\nYour mind will make the system stronger. You will be ONE OF US.</p>"

However, to accomplish his conquest and become a truly powerful and feared dark lord, you will have to commit some really vile deeds. One of your first missions, for example, involves slaughtering baby seals.<br />\nThe game follows the Overlord from his childhood, as he grows from a nasty kid to a mighty dark knight that looks a lot like Sauron as shown in The Fellowship of the Ring movie. The Overlord begins his conquest with a pack of goblins and a single troll, but over time his minions will develop into more powerful and deadly creatures and attack the enemy in large hordes. The game does not turn into a strategy, however, as you still only directly control the dark lord himself, and the minions are commanded through his orders.  Overlord II is famous for its humor: the game does not take itself too seriously. There are all sorts of puns and parodies on the stereotypical villains and other fantasy tropes, such as elves and fairies. Goblin minions squeak, cringe and fall, while playful Danny-Elfman-esque music is echoing in the background.</p>"

It is the first game in the series to feature MMO-kind of gameplay, where every players&#39; action affects the plot of the games universe. This is the fourth installment in the Elite video games series and it&#39;s the sequel to Frontier: First Encounters. This is one of those successful Kickstarter campaigns which launched in 2012. The pre-released version of Elite Dangerous was available since December 2013 and after one long year it was finally released as a full game on Microsoft Windows. In 2015 it was released on OS X and Xbox One and one year later  - on PlayStation 4. The game also supports VR devices including HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.<br />\nElite Dangerous is set in a year 3304. Its premise, as with the other games in the series, is to start as a small ship with a small amount of money and then with measures of trading, mining, bounty-hunting, piracy and assassination to go up your career. <br />\nThere are three different factions in the game including Empire of Achenar, the Galactic Federation, and the Alliance of Independent Systems and four player status levels (combat, CQC Championship, exploration and trading).</p>"

The game starts with Mario fighting Bowser on its aircraft. Bowers knock Mario off the ship and shreds his cap into pieces. Mario awakens in the Cap Kingdom inhabited with hat-like spirits and befriends one of them named Cappy. It turns out, Bowser also kidnapped Cappy\u2019s sister Tiara, and now the heroes must chase Bowser through several kingdoms to save Peach and Tiara. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay of Super Mario Odyssey draws inspiration from Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. The game consists 17 levels (named as \u201ckingdoms\u201d). In most of them, your goal is to collect a certain amount of Power Moons. Collecting enough of them allows the player to progress to the next kingdom. Some moons can be found in different parts of the level or acquired as a reward for completing certain tasks or challenges. The Mario\u2019s moveset mostly resembles that of Super Mario 64 and includes wall jumps, triple jumps, somersaults, long jumps, rolling on the ground. The main new gameplay feature is that Mario can throw his hat to create temporary platforms, grab objects, attack enemies, or possess them. Possessing enemies gives you new moves and sometimes is necessary to reach certain parts of the level.</p>"

While the Ultimate Evil himself is an embodied spirit, he can control minions that fight and build facilities. The Evil, in his turn, has to keep them happy so the minions could continue their work and stay loyal.<br />\nThe game combines elements of a real-time strategy and dungeon manager. The simulation part of the game is focused on the underworld where you are to build dungeons and summon new monsters that will serve you. As soon as you decide to go up and occupy several castles, Dungeons 2 turns into a tactical game where you need to manage your units effectively.<br />\nDungeons 2, as a follower of Dungeons, keeps its sarcastic spirit and the narration that helps you to understand the tasks and just entertains you. Despite the dark setting of the game, it\u2019s full of pop culture references including Lord of the Rings and Warcraft, and filled with dark humor.</p>"

Each level of the game is linear, as the player must often either retrieve information, some device or reach the checkpoint. However, there are numerous obstacles on the way to the objective: the protagonist has to fight off not only demons and their servants, but also combat the natural enemy in the form of darkness. </p>\n<h3>Graphics and music</h3>\n<p>The engine of the game incorporates lighting and shadowing, making every object in the game feel real and natural. The textures are designed to be unappealing, as a psychological tool to ensure the player\u2019s urge to get rid of the enemies and escape the dark and ruined corridors, but at the same time, the level of detail in each location and each enemy is very high.</p>"

        "description": "The Game:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHere is a sandbox like no other. Create massive battles with absolutely no limits. Want to see 10,000 chickens fight an army of Romans?? Sure, why not. Want to see a company of WW2 U.S soldiers fight 11,000 Medieval soldiers?? There are simply no limits to the carnage you can achieve in Epic Battle Simulator. Mess around with a massive variety of units. Everything from, Roman Centurions, Medieval soldiers, Knights, Orcs, Trolls, and yes, chickens! The main focus in this game is giving the player no restrictions to what he can do. That is why we decided not to limit the amount of units in battle. Want to see what a battle of 100,000 units looks like? We don't recommend going past 10,000 for most machines but its your CPU, do what you want! On top of that, you can play as any one of the units in the game, getting up close and personal to help change the tides of a massive battle, while rallying teammates and giving them orders!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Technology:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUnfortunately there really aren't many engines that you can chuck 10,000 characters in and expect good performance. This is why I worked months on end to create the most powerful crowd rendering system ever conceived in Unity engine. The detail of each character has little effect on performance while each individual acts independently, but is working towards a greater good for his team.  Each individual decides his own path and navigates complex environments. But I didn't stop there! With the large open environments, I needed a more dynamic lighting solution than the one built in to Unity engine. So I built my own dynamic global illumination lighting engine. This enables bounce light completely in real time. What does that mean? That means every piece of shiny armor is reflecting it's true surroundings, every bright surfaces illuminates it's surroundings and effects the overall lighting. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYes I worked hard to bring this game to life, may you all inflict carnage upon it!"

The game was developed by the Japanese studio Team Ninja for the Sony PlayStation 4 console and PC in 2017. The development team previously released projects such as Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive. The version of the game for the PC contains all the additional content that came out on the console.</p>\n<h3>The setting</h3>\n<p>The game takes place in the seventeenth century Japan, in the fictionalized version of the Sengoku period, when the country was engulfed in the flames of civil war. The player takes control of the An Anglo-Irish sailor named William, who sets out in pursuit of the villain in the country of the rising sun and finds himself entangled in the mystical and political upheavals that pervaded all of Japan. Despite the fantasy elements, the plot uses real prototypes of historical events and personalities.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The controls are quite simple: two types of attack, block and dodge are available. The gameplay is modified by role-playing elements: for example, at the start of the game, it is necessary to choose which weapon in William will be predefined. This helps to determine which skills to develop, with further completion. Like Dark Souls, enemies are reborn after each interaction with the local analog of bonfires - Shrines.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Eve Online is a massively multiplayer role-playing game and space simulator. The games initially required the monthly subscription but later got the limited free-to-play version. EVE Online is set in an expansive sci-fi world. The player controls starship and has the freedom to explore the in-game world at his own pace. There are many diffident activities for players ranging from quiet trading, mining, and manufacturing to full-on real-time space battles that can last for many hours and include hundreds of players.  <br />\nOne of the game\u2019s main features is freedom of player interaction. Many aspects of the game such as economics can be described as player-driven. Players can form corporations and alliances that can conquer some of the game\u2019s 7800+ star systems. This leads to a lot of unique and unscripted situations affecting in-game politics and economics. Another notable part of the game is that real-world money can be used to buy different items that sometimes can cost hundreds of dollars.</p>"

Scribe any word in it, and it becomes real (of course, only if the word you wrote describes a particular object). The game will understand your written words and create interactive in-game objects. They are used to solve puzzles, which earns you Starites, the ultimate goal of the game. The ability to summon any imaginable item gives you an almost unlimited number of ways you can solve any puzzle.<br />\nScribblenauts Unlimited features a way more detailed plot than its predecessors. There&#39;s an extensive backstory that explains the protagonist&#39;s motivation in gathering Starites. We learn that Max and his sister Lily played pranks on people using their magic notebook until it got them into trouble. One day they unknowingly played a trick against an old wizard. He grew angry and magically turned Lily into stone. Max can only save his sister by gathering enough Starites. Unlike previous parts, this game is set in an open, albeit cartoonish, world, that gradually opens to you as you gather more Starites. The tasks are now assigned by the NPCs, and Starites are given as a reward for help. Thus, they serve as the proof that Max has corrected his behavior.</p>"

He is a hired assassin with a mission. He has to buy a very ancient katana with powers to kill immortals. When arrives at the place of the deal, everything turns in quite a disaster. Demons attack and slay everything in its path and Lo Wang decides to cooperate with them in order to bound three swords into one, making this very old and ancient katana a real and unstoppable force. </p>\n<p>Even though games setup is in modern days, it&#39;s been very firmly connected with old Asian mythology. Shadow Realm is filled with some very famous Asian demons that play key parts in a plot. Defeating hordes of demons is quite fun as you have plenty of ways to do so. Wang can shoot his enemies with weapons like pistols, submachine guns or even rocket launchers (some of this weapon can be dual-wielded) or slash them with your katana. High dependent on controls and patterns can create some unique attacks, and makes killing your enemies a very fun occupation.</p>"

Over the course of a run, the player will gain experience levels and find a multitude of items to improve their abilities and eventually become immensely powerful. However, difficulty constantly increases with time and death is permanent. Through various achievements, they can unlock new items that will appear in future runs as well as 12 different playable characters. They can also learn more about the lore of the game through collectible logs regarding monsters and items.</p>\n<p>While lesser known, Risk of Rain was one of the games that contributed to the launch of the roguelite trend between 2010 and 2015. It is notable for its unique gameplay mechanics such as item stacking and looping, its gratifying endgame, its approach to storytelling, its art direction and its soundtrack composed by Chris Christodoulou.</p>"

The class system is absent as the developers want the players to define their own classes using the weapons of their own creation.</p>\n<p>There are no in-game paywalls, but if the player wants to unlock all the customization options or the best weapon modules, they have to either grind the in-game currency or buy it for real money.</p>\n<p>The game features 4 competitive multiplayer modes and a co-op mode where 4 players complete missions which are divided into 5 or 6 parts with each mission having a different goal. A lot of missions revolve around killing aliens known as Kroads. After each mission, the players are awarded loot boxes, in-game currency or other in-game items.</p>"

It is the first installment of the series.</p>\n<p>In a fictional kingdom of Mirtana, the armies of king Robar the Second encountered orcs and lost battle after battle. The only mean of fighting back was the special equipment made from magical ore. This ore was mined by the prisoners regardless of their crimes. The game revolves around an unnamed protagonist and the story of his escape from the mine. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses one of the three camps to join. </p>\n<p>In combat, pressing the fight preparation button results in pulling out your weapon, preparing your magic spells or the character just raises his fists. Every object, even a friendly one, could be attacked in battle mode. The game features close and middle range combat. </p>\n<p>The player&#39;s inventory is unlimited. It can fit every object the player finds. Every item that was picked up gets sorted and put into one of the categories. Magic is present in the game. Players can either use runes, which grant permanent boosts or one time spells. The role-playing system features several weapon handling, hunting skills, sneaking, pickpocketing and magic levels.</p>"

South Park already had attempted to make quality games, but until recently they were unsuccessful. In this case, the stars converged and the game, like its predecessor, proved to be successful.</p>\n<h3>Geniuses at work</h3>\n<p>The developers themselves were the creators of the original show - Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The plot of the game is in no way connected with the previous part, except for the time when events unfold: a day after the events of the previous game. In this iteration, Cartman and the children decide to dress up as superheroes and create their mega-popular franchise, like Marvel. The player joins the action as before in the role of the The New Kid and becomes a witness in the adventures of Cartman and the team.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>Gameplay-wise the game has not changed much: it&#39;s still a game similar to jRPG with step-by-step battles and a pseudo-open world, which is divided into story locations. Using a 2.5D player explores the fictional town of South Park Colorado. In the game, classes are available, and they are South Park-style satire on the classic RPG classes. The main change in the combat system is visual: now instead of a static battlefield, players and NPCs can move freely along the battlefield divided into blocks and use its features to create a tactical advantage.</p>"

The action takes place in the midst of the cold war, which has an impact on the course of events.</p>\n<p>The primary task is to ensure the fulfillment of five basic needs for each resident: food (the requirement to build farms), housing (if a resident does not have a house, or he has nothing to pay for it, he makes shacks that spoil the beauty of the city and increase crime), religion (construction of temples), entertainment (build bars, cafes, cinemas) and medical support (construction of hospitals)</p>\n<p>How the government provides these aspects to its residents depends on the level of satisfaction of the population, as each need is different for each resident. If the level of happiness is low, the people can go to the rebels. And when the rebels accumulate a lot, they attack various objects, including the Palace. Undermining the Palace means defeat in the game, so in case of a low level of happiness, a vast army has to suppress the riots. But the military, in turn, must also be happy with life. Otherwise, a military coup may occur.</p>"

The main theme of the game - survival during a zombie apocalypse.</p>\n<p>It has an open and changing world, many opportunities for the manufacture of useful things and cooperation with other characters, to fight hunger, injuries, depression and paranoia.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game takes place in Knox County, Kentucky, USA.</p>\n<p>As a result of the epidemic, a huge part of the population of the district became infected with an unknown virus and turned into a zombie. The few survivors will have to fight for survival.</p>\n<p>The player plays as one of the survivors. The game does not have any definite ending, it cannot be won and it will end when the player\u2019s character dies - and it depends only on him how late it will happen.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game begins with the creation of a character.</p>\n<p>The player can choose the name, gender, race, hairstyle, initial clothing, as well as the presence of a beard and chest hair in a male character.</p>\n<p>Then begins the creation of character and part of the background of the character. You can choose the character&#39;s profession before the apocalypse. Subsequently, this will affect some of the skills (for example, a former policeman shoots better, a builder builds defenses better, nurses heal wounds more successfully, cooks cook better, etc.).</p>\n<p>You can then choose the positive and negative traits of the character. The negative ones include obesity, laziness, poor eyesight, chronic fatigue, constant thirst, etc. For the chosen negative traits you get points - these points can be spent on the positive traits of this character, such as agility, strength, high disease resistance and even luck.</p>\n<p>After creating a character, you (or rather, a character) find yourself in a randomly selected house on a game map. The zombie apocalypse has already begun, and your character has to look for a way to survive. In the game, not even very moral ways are allowed to do this: you can loot and rob, you can create a group of honest people and resist both zombies and bandits.</p>\n<p>In addition to winning battles, the hero needs food, water, sleep, rest, and fellowship to survive - constant loneliness can lead to depression.</p>\n<p>The complexity of the game increases constantly and gradually - the activity of zombies increases, electricity and water supply are turned off, and the products deteriorate. However, the player is able to provide a lot for himself - to cook food on a fire, collect rainwater, grow food.</p>\n<p>However, no action can ensure eternal survival - sooner or later the character dies. The slogan at the beginning of each new game is pessimistic: \u201cThis is the story of your death.\u201d</p>"

        "description": "<p>Skullgirls is a fighting game developed by Lab Zero and primarily published by Marvelous and Autumn Games. Since its initial release in 2012, it has received two free extensions, Skullgirls Encore and Skullgirls 2nd Encore and while its roster initially consisted of an all-female cast of 8 characters, 6 more characters were added, 5 being developed thanks to the game&#39;s Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, including 2 male characters. At its release, Skullgirls was developed by Reverge Labs, but the team that created the game split off from the company to form Lab Zero. In Japan, the game is published by Arc System Works. On Nintendo Switch, the game is published by Skybound Games.</p>\n<p>Skullgirls takes place in the Canopy Kingdom, inspired by 1940s America, in which corruption and conflict runs rampant. Once every seven years, an artifact called the Skull Heart appears, granting the wish of one woman. However, if the Skull Heart is used by a woman with impure intentions, it will control her, turning her into a destructive monster called the Skullgirl. Not once has anyone used the Skull Heart without falling to its curse. The game follows the stories of 14 characters on their way to face the Skullgirl and retrieve the Heart, be it for the greater good or simply their own gain.</p>\n<p>The game is a tribute to Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and its mechanics are intended as a more polished version of the classic fighting game title, with some original ideas. In a standard player vs. player match, each player controls one character out a chosen number of one to three characters which they can switch to at any time. They can also call their inactive characters to perform assist attacks. Like most Marvel vs. Capcom-inspired games, Skullgirls is fast-paced and features long, complex combos based on animation cancels. It introduces a burst system which allows players to break their opponent&#39;s combo if it becomes too long.</p>\n<p>Skullgirls features a &#39;dark deco&#39;-inspired art style mixed with some horror themes and a jazz and rock soundtrack consisting of 28 tracks. In 2013, the game set the Guinness World Record Gamer&#39;s Edition record for most average frames of animation per character in a video game, reaching 1,439 frames per character and 11,515 frames total for its initial eight-character roster.</p>\n<p>In February 2013, Skullgirls came in second in a crowdfunding event organized by fighting game website Shoryuken to decide what would be the final game featured on the EVO 2013 line up, with all proceeds sent to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Skullgirls raised over $US 78,000. While it was not featured as an EVO main game, EVO organizers supported the game&#39;s side event by providing prize money and advertisement.</p>"

Despite these releases coming out years ago, they are still alive and actively updated. But the developers at Blizzard wanted something new: the company does not like to experiment with new settings, preferring to transfer existing characters to new genres, worlds, and situations. The exception, perhaps, can only be a game about the three Vikings\u2014The Lost Vikings, but this, too, was a long time ago.</p>\n<h3>The story and setting</h3>\n<p>Anyway, the company Blizzard has approached the development of Overwatch with team-specific meticulousness to details and desire to create an elaborative game universe. The player faces a choice between 21 characters who were part of the elite Overwatch unit. The task of Overwatch soldiers is to protect the Earth from conflicts and external threats. But something goes wrong, and the team of heroes breaks up. Despite the multiplayer bias, the game has a full story, it combines all the characters and maps on which the battle takes place. Since the launch, seven new characters have been added to the hero pool. Blizzard tells the story of the world of Overwatch through their characters: almost everyone has an animated short film, comparable in quality to a full meter from, for example, Pixar.</p>\n<h3>Continuous support</h3>\n<p>The game won the hearts of players around the world immediately after the launch. The figures confirm this fact: more than half a million dollars from sales and more than 40 million players. Overwatch has become an anchor project for Activision Blizzard, and the company continues to develop the project two years later, constantly offering players new maps, new characters, new themed events, and new cosmetic skins.</p>"

It is a sequel to STAR WARS: The Force Unleashed released in 2008. The game was created during nine months development cycle and despite some similarities to the first one, TFUII offered elements such as modified sound effects and gameplay. The main protagonist of TFUII is a clone of Starkiller, who has a secret history with Dart Vader. The main goal of a game is to find your true identity and find protagonist&#39;s love \u2013 Juno Eclipse. The game takes place about six months after the events of the first entry in the series and one year before the first Star Wars film. TFUII is known for its dark and much more personal story compared to the first game. There are two main weapons in the game \u2013 The Force itself and a famous lightsaber with which you can do various different combos. TFUII also adds another new element \u2013 puzzles, the ability to wield two lightsabers at a time and more Force powers then the original.</p>"

The game uses realistic physics system and was often compared to Kerbal Space Program. Each machine has to be assembled before use. The player is given a variety of modules to build from, and they include all kinds of weaponry, not necessarily medieval. Using improbable combinations of wheels, drills, spikes, blades, propellers, cannons, and water hoses you can turn your death machine into a plane, a tank, a robot, or rather something not found in the real world. Each machine is built with a purpose to complete a level objective, be it to destroy an enemy castle, slaughter the opposing army, or move an object to a destination. Levels include many kinds of obstacles, such as landmines, trees, rocks, and enemy soldiers. <br />\nThe machines can be of any shape, however grotesque or impractical. If they\u2019re not well-thought or too shaky to withstand attacks and obstacles, they will fall apart, catch fire, or explode. However, failing spectacularly is half the fun of Besiege.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines is a story-driven action-RPG based on table-top role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade, the part of the World of Darkness franchise. The game is setting a gothic urban fantasy where vampires, werewolves, and other supernatural beings live secretly by humans. The story follows the player character that gets turned into the vampire and becomes a member of Camarilla \u2013 a considerable vampire organization that tries to keep vampires\u2019 existence in secret from ordinary people. It confronts Sabbat, an organization whose member believe that Vampires should let their inner beasts go wild no matter of people\u2019s awareness.  </p>\n<p>The gameplay\u2019s primary emphasis is variety in player\u2019s action. The same goals can be achieved in several ways. Depending on the character\u2019s abilities and clan affiliation, it can intimidate, seduce or convince NPC\u2019s with words, use brute force or sneak in the shadows without being noticed. There are seven unique vampire clans from which player creates his character. They have different skills, supernatural powers, appearance, characteristics. Some of them affect gameplay in its unique way, e.g., vampires from Nosferatu clan are so deformed that they cannot be seen by ordinary people, forcing the player to rely on stealth and brute force rather than communication.</p>"

Everything what player sees is filtered by lo-fi visual effects and so everything looks like filmed with an old and cheap digital photo camera.

The protagonist arrives at the kingdom of Mrytana that was recently conquered by a horde of orcs with the help of a rogue wizard. Only a handful of humans, led by their king, still maintain their resistance in the capital that is protected by a magic shield. The rest of the human population is enslaved by orcs. The Nameless Hero is expected to save the kingdom; however, the player is free to choose to help orcs instead or even side with some other faction, like Nomads. There are six factions in the game, of which three will allow the protagonist to join after he reaches a certain level of reputation with them. <br />\nLike previous parts of its series, Gothic 3 is set in an open-world high fantasy setting, and its gameplay reminds that of The Elder Scrolls series. You can explore cities, forests and deep underground caves, accept quests from NPCs, and fight a variety of monsters and wild animals to level up and learn additional skills for battle, magic or crafting. The world of Gothic 3 is vast, though somewhat empty and nearly devoid of female characters.</p>"

Every level features from four to twelve waves; each Orc that reaches your Rift damages it a little. Once the Rift Score is 0, you need to start the level over. \u00a0<br />\nThe title uses a third-person perspective that makes it look like a classic action game. To protect the Rift, you can not only use different traps and spells but also fight Orcs yourself. If you&#39;re killed, you&#39;ll respawn near your Rift for a certain score.\u00a0<br />\nEach trap or spell costs the in-game currency you earn by defeating enemies. At the beginning of the level, you choose up to ten items for the battle. As a rule, all traps only work once and then need some time to recharge. Every item is upgradable; on higher levels, you can also get some boosts that will affect that level only.<br />\nThe game is followed by Orcs Must Die! 2 that features a co-op mode, and Orcs Must Die!

Resist, and turn darkness against itself. Or embrace corruption, and become ultimate evil.</p>\n<p>From the creators of Divinity: Original Sin 2 comes a next-generation RPG, set in the world of Dungeons and Dragons.</p>\n<p>Choose from a wide selection of D&amp;D races and classes, or play as an origin character with a hand-crafted background. Adventure, loot, battle and romance as you journey through the Forgotten Realms and beyond. Play alone, and select your companions carefully, or as a party of up to four in multiplayer.</p>\n<p>Abducted, infected, lost. You are turning into a monster, but as the corruption inside you grows, so does your power. That power may help you to survive, but there will be a price to pay, and more than any ability, the bonds of trust that you build within your party could be your greatest strength. Caught in a conflict between devils, deities, and sinister otherworldly forces, you will determine the fate of the Forgotten Realms together.</p>\n<p>Forged with the new Divinity 4.0 engine, Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 gives you unprecedented freedom to explore, experiment, and interact with a world that reacts to your choices. A grand, cinematic narrative brings you closer to your characters than ever before, as you venture through our biggest world yet.</p>\n<p>The Forgotten Realms are a vast, detailed and diverse world, and there are secrets to be discovered all around you -- verticality is a vital part of exploration. Sneak, dip, shove, climb, and jump as you journey from the depths of the Underdark to the glittering rooftops of the Upper City. How you survive, and the mark you leave on the world, is up to you.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Deceit is a six-player multiplayer horror game developed by Automaton.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Deceit is heavily influenced by the Trouble In Terrorist Town Half-Life 2 mod. All six players spawn on a vast map, with several of your group being infected with a virus that allows them to transform in their terror form. The players have to figure out who is infected, kill them or at least attempt an escape. </p>\n<p>Most of the time, the map is lit up by portable lamps and projectors, yet there are blackout periods that last several minutes. During these periods, the infected players can transform into the terror form in which they become faster, stronger, and have night vision. They can only be countered using light. </p>\n<p>For the non-infected players, there are several objectives placed around the map, like turning on the generators, finding light sources or weapons. These objectives both increase the chance of player survival and sometimes allow the players to escape off the map. </p>\n<p>The gameplay heavily relies on its psychological component with the maps being designed in a way to place a seed of doubt in the players&#39; heads. The players have to decide with whom they&#39;d want to stay close to or leave behind. It is necessary to display your intentions correctly, so the game features an emote system, which allows the players who do not have a microphone to interact with the others.</p>"

Instead, you need to set paths for them through the city streets and use different boosts to make your attack more effective and help the convoy survive.\u00a0<br />\nAnomaly: Warzone Earth is followed by Anomaly 2 that presents several new maps and mechanics including tower defense vs. tower offense multiplayer mode.</p>"

While the game has a single-player mode, the gameplay is more suitable for a co-op playthrough. Unlike in many shooters, in HELLDIVERS you must avoid friendly fire as you can hurt your teammates. Another feature is that you can decide for yourself where to drop, which vehicles to use and choose the order of the objectives to complete.<br />\nThe story is set on Super Earth where the government brainwashes people to make them more loyal. While the planet is surrounded by enemy creatures that intend to destroy it, you play as a soldier of a HELLDIVERS unite who needs to protect Super Earth. As a rule, the missions include forcing through an enemy base, capturing required objectives and escape. There&#39;s no need to kill all the enemies as they are endless; instead, you can try to complete the mission stealthier. Before the mission, you can choose weapons from a variety of equipment and also get support firepower during the battle.</p>"

These missions can be taken in whichever order the players see fit. There are six districts present on the planet. Mason has to gain the trust and respect of the residents from the whole districts to make them join his side, lower the enemy presence, and in the end, put the regime to end.</p>\n<p>The game&#39;s world is highly interactive with the players being able to bring every building they want down thanks to an advanced physics model. This feature is used a lot in the game, as many quests will have Mason demolishing administration buildings, infrastructure and so on. The in-game currency is given out to the players for the destruction of the environment and mission completion.</p>\n<h3>Re-Mars-tered Edition features</h3>\n<p>No gameplay changes were applied whatsoever. However, the game&#39;s graphics engine was heavily reworked and modified which allowed for native 4K and HDR support.</p>"

It\u2019s combined with platforming as you explore the city climbing walls and jumping over obstacles, and fights with enemies. If you make a mistake during these activities, you can go back to ten seconds and change your actions. The Dagger also allows to slow time and freeze enemies. You can\u2019t customize the protagonist, however, you can upgrade his health and power at special points within levels. <br />\nThe game consists of several levels full of multiple traps and environmental puzzles. Some levels are cooperative and you complete them together with your AI companion, Farah. While Prince uses melee combat and different tricks, she fires a bow at enemies. You need to protect Farah because the game ends if she dies..</p>"

The player assumes the role of a Republic commando who leads his group of four Clone troopers, the Delta Squad, through various military missions. You only directly control the commander of the squad, Delta-38 aka Boss, the other three characters are AI-controlled NPCs that you can give orders to. They are known only by their codenames and have different specializations: Sev is a sniper, Fixer is a technician, and Scorch is explosives expert. The player is not fully identified with the main character, and if Boss is shot down, the player can order his comrades to revive him or to continue on with the mission. The level is only considered failed if the whole Delta Squad is down.<br />\nThe plot revolves around the Clone Wars that was fought between movie Episodes II and III. The Delta Squad fights against the Separatist forces on the various planets, among them Geonosis and the Wookie homeland Kashyyk. A few classic Star Wars characters make appearances, most prominently, General Grievous as a boss and Master Yoda at a mission briefing. The game\u2019s soundtrack contains the excerpts from the Star Wars film score, some original music, and a song by Indie Rock band Ash.</p>"

During that time people with superpowers known as Conduits start to appear. Most of the conduits died fighting the outbreak. After these events, the U.S. government established the Department of Unified Protection. The Conduits are considered bio-terrorists and held prisoner. The game tells the story of Abigail Walker who possesses the power of neon, how she was captured by the D.U.P. and imprisoned in Curdun Cay. The story is set 3 years before the events of InFAMOUS Second Son.</p>\n<p>The game focuses on the neon power that was one of the powers present in InFAMOUS Second Son. Neon power is used for distant precise powerful attacks. The Neon Beam deals a lot of damage yet it has a low fire rate. In addition to normal Neon Beam, it is possible to use Stasis Bubbles that freeze the enemies. A more powerful charged Phosphor Beam is also present. Players can travel at high speeds using the Light Speed.</p>"

Because, let\u2019s face it, you\u2019ll do anything to win.</strong>LOCAL AND ONLINE MULTIPLAYER, BUT SUPER WEIRD<br/>Challenge your friends to insane brawls, where the goal is to pluck heads from shoulders and use them to get that much-desired victory! Headsnatchers has 25 ridiculous maps with unique, yet unlikely, weapons and features, with their own steps and rules to follow. Well, they\u2019re more like guidelines. Nobody likes rules. Dunk your buddies\u2019 heads through hoops like LeBron, kick your grandpa\u2019s gobbler through a portal to hell like Doomguy\u2122 and flush your sister\u2019s brain-basket down the toilet like the dooky you pushed out five hours after you shoved that XL pizza down your face. You name it, Headsnatchers has got it. Probably.<br/><br/>*The online mode currently has 6 playable maps, but that number will grow as Headsnatchers continues development in Early Access. Custom heads aren\u2019t supported in the online mode at this time. Keep an eye on the Steam announcements and forum to stay up to date!<br/><br/>OFF WITH THEIR (100+) HEADS<br/>Because apparently kids nowadays are all about self-expression and unique identifiers, we felt we couldn\u2019t stay behind the times. With over 100 unique heads to choose from, there\u2019s a head for everyone. Did we mention there are pop culture references? There\u2019s a head that resembles that one angry guy from that anime you used to love, and one from a children's show with a certain mathematically challenged Count. If you don\u2019t like any of those, make your own heads using the Headitor! You can save up to 20 heads, so go nuts trying to recreate those school dweebs who used to pick you last for gym.<br/><br/>A SINGLE-PLAYER MODE MADE JUST FOR YOU<br/>Sometimes you just need a little me-time - we totally get it. Rip it up in the single-player Zombie Castle-mode! This single-player feature spans across three different difficulty levels. \u201cBut, my dudes, every game has multiple difficulties nowadays\u201d, we hear you thinking. Zombie Castle is different throughout its easy, normal and hard modes. Different levels, different everything, same zombies. We\u2019re calling it right now: you can\u2019t beat them all. Probably.OBLIGATORY KEY FEATURE BULLET POINTS<br/>We\u2019re sorry, but we just have to go over all of the features one last time. Okay, ready?<br/><br/><ul><li>Local and online* multiplayer, support up to 4 players<br/></li><li>4 game modes and 25 unique levels<br/></li><li>Zombie Castle single-player mode, for when you really need some me-time<br/></li><li>Choose from 100 heads<br/></li><li>A limitless custom head creator* (yes, we\u2019re calling it the Headitor, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it) that allows you to save up to 20 custom heads*</li></ul><br/>*The online mode currently has 6 playable maps, but that number will grow as Headsnatchers continues development in Early Access.

You control only one character at a time while AI commands your teammates, but you can instantly switch between them.<br />\nThe game also supports multiplayer for two with drop-in/drop-out system so the second player can join you without going back to the main menu. The gameplay mostly consists of solving puzzles, exploring environments for secrets and fighting enemies and bosses. There are many characters to unlock as well as other collectibles. Different characters have different abilities and weapons the can be used in combat, puzzle-solving or accessing previously closed parts of the map. There is no game over in Lego Star Wars.

The sequel to Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War, the game follows its tendency to simplify strategy aspect and focus on battles. So, base building is removed; instead, you can explore locations and kill various monsters.\u00a0<br />\nThe game&#39;s story places you in the middle of the war on the desert planet Calderis. While helping another group, your Space Marines squad is attacked by Orks. This battle starts a whole string of missions, which the campaign mode consists of. The plot had several endings; unlike in previous games, here you need to pick units up before the fight and can&#39;t change them later.\u00a0<br />\nDawn of War 2 extends the series\u2019 role-play features. You can choose from four races and form armies of six different squads. Every race and squad has its own characteristic. The game also places a heavier focus on weapons and cover with improved physics, additionally making the experience more realistic in a way fights between huge mechs can be.</p>"

There he fights against a cult that spoils the life of civilians.<br />\nYou can develop the hunter&#39;s skills and upgrade his weapon and magic possession. Van Helsing Junior also has an ally, a ghost named Catherine who helps him in battles. Depending on your choice how to upgrade her, she can be a tank or a healer. The variety of weapons is not very huge; however, there are several ways to customize your character cosmetically.\u00a0\u00a0<br />\nWhile the developers took inspiration from Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula, the game only slightly reminds of this novel. However, they successfully caught the atmosphere of a little 19th-century town and filled it with deep NPCs and interesting technological details.</p>"

The players have to collect colored blocks known as &quot;cars&quot; and form clusters of three or more blocks of the same color. Hot colors such as red or orange get the player more points than cold ones such as blue or purple. The more clusters formed - the more score the player gets. Players are also awarded different bonuses depending on how did they complete the race. Players are also awarded one of the medals: bronze, silver or gold based on the selected difficulty.</p>\n<p>Players are free to choose one of 14 different vehicles to use. Each vehicle belongs to one of the three difficulty groups and has unique abilities. Using different vehicles may change the gameplay drastically.</p>\n<p>The main feature of Audiosurf is the synchronization of the track, traffic pattern, and color with the song you choose. The song dynamics affect the track elevation (in case of a song build-up for example).</p>\n<p>On launch, the game featured the soundtrack from Valve&#39;s The Orange Box and songs from independent artists. Players can also choose any track saved on their PC.</p>"

We have to fly to &#39;Far, Far Range&#39;, to build there something like a ranch for slimes and for all this to hire earthlings. One of these earthlings, the space rancheros, the brave young girl Beatrix LeBeau is the character of the game. The girl (and the player) will fly a thousand light-years in a deep sleep to equip a ranch from a Hobson Twillgers, study the planet&#39;s environment, collect, feed and breed slimes.</p>\n<p>To get the necessary hints the girl can look for notes of the former owner - they meet on the territory of the ranch, and also communicate via Star Mail with a close friend from the Earth. In conversations with a friend, we learn a lot of things about the former, earthly life of the heroine - this information will be important.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay and economics</h3>\n<p>Slimes need to be fed, and this is important. The rest they will do themselves.<br />\nIt is necessary to feed them not by anything, but by appropriate products. But slimes will produce a lot of Plort - and Plort can be sold on the market, having received currency - newbucks. For newbucks you can buy equipment for ranches and so on. The world of the game is not known until the end, it is possible and necessary to travel through it, opening up new locations, finding new slimes for the ranch, as well as food for slimes and other new resources.</p>\n<p>From different types of slimes you can get hybrids. However, with this you need to be more careful - you can get aggressive evil slimes, which will have to be dissolved with water.</p>\n<p>Slimes are quite diverse. Ordinary slimes are generally friendly, but they can be dangerous not because of evil will, but because of some natural features like thorns, emitted radiation or the ability to explode.</p>\n<p>Some slimes are more productive than others, they produce more Plort. It is these slimes that are created by hybridization, since it is difficult to find them in a natural environment.</p>\n<p>Ordinary slimes sometimes merge into a huge Gordo-slime - inside such organisms there are often valuable resources and other interesting and useful things. To get all this, you need to blow up the Gordo-slime.</p>\n<h3>Game modes</h3>\n<p>Adventure. The world is open for research, there are no serious restrictions. You can develop as you want. You can communicate with other ranchers, carry out their assignments and exchange resources with them. </p>\n<p>Carefree is an adventure mode that goes even easier.</p>\n<p>The five-day trial is a mode in which you need to earn as many newbucks as possible in 5 days.</p>\n<p>&quot;The steel master of the ranch&quot; - the conditions in this mode are so complicated that it resembles a game of survival. In the mode there are unique tests that change the impression of the game.</p>"

Designed and released in 1996 by the authors of the groundbreaking game Doom - iD Software. This is the first game to start the still ongoing series. Unlike its famous predecessor, the game uses an engine capable of rendering full-fledged 3D: the game supports an earlier version of 3D acceleration through OpenGL. After moving to a new engine, the game needed a new control scheme: the movement is now possible in all three directions, including the vertical axis. This feature added to the game an additional difficulty: player have to expect the enemy attack from any direction. The game also has a full-fledged multiplayer, the previous version of which the Doom players liked.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>In a single player campaign, the player takes control of the main character named Ranger, who went to the portal in order to stop the unknown enemies, code-named Quake. The plot of the adventure consists of 32 separate levels. Six more maps are available in multiplayer for the battles between the players for deathmatch mayhem. Two mission packs were released for the game, which adds new enemies, new levels, new maps, new weapons and a new experience for players to the original game. Both packs were greatly received by both players and critics.</p>"

On her way, Alice will jump the platforms, solve puzzles, and fight enemies. The combat system allows for a seamless flow of attacks, dodges, and combos. Besides her trademark Vorpal Blade, Alice will use other, somewhat surreal weapons, such as Teapot Cannon, Clockwork Bomb, or Pepper Grinder.

        "description": "<p>The Last Guardian is a brainchild of Fumito Ueda, who also created Shadow of the Colossus. The game spent almost a decade in development before it was complete. The Last Guardian is defined by its spectacular mountain landscapes, eerie music, and a heartwarming mood.<br />\nThe main protagonist is a nameless boy, who is kept as a prisoner in cyclopean castle ruins and has to escape. While in captivity, the boy\u2019s first task is to befriends his cellmate, a fantasy creature named Trico, who is a gigantic half-bird, half-cat hybrid that slightly reminds a hippogriff. Trico is the second main character and the mascot of The Last Guardian; the creature\u2019s animation is incredibly detailed, and its behavior is modeled after real animals. The two form an unlikely symbiosis. The boy needs the creature\u2019s strength and ability to fly to overcome obstacles and fend off guards who try to bring the characters back to their cells. Trico, in turn, needs the boy\u2019s wits and agility to sneak, solve puzzles, feed the creature and heal its wounds. The player only controls the boy, while Trico needs to be manipulated into performing certain actions. Over time, the characters develop a strong emotional bond that adds to the game\u2019s impact on the player.</p>"

Battlefield Hardline also tried to refresh series and instead on focusing on military warfare, Hardline is about crime, heist ant policing elements. The game takes place in the streets of Los Angeles and there are two main factions in the game - Special Response Units of police and criminals. As in the other Battlefield games, players have an option to use various vehicles and weapons. As in Battlefield 4, Hardline uses the \u201cLevolution\u201d mechanic, which lets players completely destroy various buildings, and this mechanic is almost in every mission of Battlefield: Hardline. There are also new game modes, including Heist, Rescue, Hotwire, Blood Money and Crosshair. <br />\nBattlefield: Hardline is the last game made by Visceral Games. It was promised prior to the release of the game that the main single-player campaign will not be linear \u2013 it features episodic crime dramas, where players have to choose how they want the story to go.</p>"

The protagonist is Starkiller (a reference to the early draft version of Skywalker), the secret padawan of Darth Vader himself. The young apprentice is tasked with hunting down and killing the few remaining Jedi Knights. He will travel to various planets of the galaxy far, far away and fight Jedi and rebels using his lightsaber and special Force abilities, such as telekinesis and force choking. Both types of attacks can be used to form combo movements. Defeating enemies earns Starkiller experience points that can be used to level up his skills.<br />\nUltimate Sith Edition includes three additional levels: two DLC missions set on Tatooine and Coruscant and a previously unreleased level set on Hoth. The Tatooine mission starts the Infinities plotline, which follows the non-canon \u201cdark\u201d ending of the original game.

Doors can become portals leading to an unpredictable place, or even different places, depending on how you enter them. The visual style of Antichamber is very minimalistic. Walls, doors, and ladders are only outlined with sketch-like black contours, while any color serves to attract the player&#39;s attention to a certain object.

It took 2 long years for Ubisoft to repair their mistakes and that resulted in Assassin\u2019s Creed II. Now, the game looks a lot better not only graphical bus also gameplay-wise. It became much more interesting and epic. <br />\nAssassin\u2019s Creed II offers a fictional history setting which as in all the others games in franchise tells a story about the never-ending war between assassins and the Knights Templars who want to control the world. The story of the game is set in modern times and it fallows Desmond Miles who once again has to go into the machine called Animus to relive his genetic memories of his ancestor who now is Ezio Auditore da Firenze.  The main story takes place in Italy during the Renaissance period in the 15th and early 16th century. Cities of Florence, Venice, Tuscany and Forli are fully explorable. Ezio fights those who betrayed his family and the player is kindly welcomed to experience this epic story as the Ezio himself.</p>"

Titans known as the Old Ones were defeated with their power being locked away inside Eternia Crystals. Bored apprentices decide to play with the Crystals and unleash the evil forces once again.</p>\n<p>The game currently has 12 different classes to choose from. Each class has a unique playstyle. For example, the Adept is a good tower character while the Countess is a tank.</p>\n<p>The players have to fight off the hordes of enemies. In order to do it, the players have to build up defenses which are different for each class. Players can also upgrade their equipment and get new weapons and armor. It is also possible to summon a personal pet which grants a buff to characters abilities and can repair the defenses.</p>\n<p>Every game mode is playable in both multiplayer and singleplayer, yet some events are online-only.</p>"

Sam is going to Sirius with SSS Centerprice starship but Crotem crate-but accidentally hits Centerprice and it falls down to Earth, in Central Amerika in the Mayan age. Lucky Sam, the Sirians left a starship on Earth in case SSS Centerprice couldn\u2019t make it. Not so good news - that this back-up starship is located in a different era and time, so Sam has to go through various portals in order to reach this starship. He travels through Mesopotamia, Mesoamerica and Medieval Europe. During this journey, Sam fights two Mental\u2019s (who is the main antagonist of the game) portal guardians: Mayan spirit called Kukulkan and the Wind God Exotech Larva. At the end of the game in front of the Cathedral of Sacred Blood Sam fights Mordekai the Summoner which is the last obstacle to reach the Holy Grail. <br />\nThe Second Encounter has not only new locations compared to the first game, but also adds new weapons and new monsters to shoot.</p>"

Originally developed as a Half-Life mod, Cry of Fear is a free-to-play horror game, that has single-player and multiplayer modes. Players take control of Simon Henriksson that finds himself after a car accident in a dark city overrun by monsters. Now Simon has to explore the city and find the source of the evil.<br />\nThis take on a psychological horror introduces several mechanics in order to make the gameplay challenging, Cry of Fear can be played in single-player and multiplayer with three other players, which doesn\u2019t change the events of the campaign. Players have limited inventory space, only six slots to manage their healing items and weapons. But, characters are allowed to dual-wield items, meaning that player is capable of finding the combination of action items for specific game sections or specific team role players might take in multiplayer. Similarly to Silent Hill series, in order to progress players will have to solve puzzles while city swaps between \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cnightmare\u201d modes.</p>"

Of course, such a setting can not be taken seriously, so the game is full of humor and Jurassic Park references.</p>\n<p>The game is oriented towards online multiplayer gameplay. The players have to pick one of two teams, Allies or Axis. Both teams can compete in a traditional frag-counting deathmatch mode, a &quot;king of the hill&quot; mode, or complete specific objectives to win. Each side has multiple character classes, but most dino classes are on the Axis side, including such spectacular specimens as fast-ambushing Velociraptor, machine-gunning Tyrannosaurus and a Triceratops with a mounted tank turret. While dinosaurs are technically stronger than humans, they have trouble reloading their firearms and can be distracted by an Allied rabbit released on the battlefield. Still, the sides are not perfectly balanced, and battles can often become chaotic.</p>"

It was the first LEGO game to be based on an original plot rather than being an adaptation of an existing story.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game is set in Gotham City. A group of supervillains once again escaped the ever unreliable Arkham Asylum. They formed three separate gangs led by Batman\u2019s arch-enemies Joker, Riddler, and Penguin, respectively. Each gang has a chapter of the game dedicated to it. Riddler\u2019s plan is to rob Gotham&#39;s gold reserves. Penguin is going to use his robotic minions to conquer Gotham. Joker wants to poison the whole city with his laughing gas. Batman and Robin have to disrupt the villains\u2019 plans.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is divided into the heroes\u2019 and villains\u2019 missions. In the heroes\u2019 missions, you play as Batman or his aides Robin, Batgirl, and Nightwing, while the playable villains change over the course of the game. Between missions, the characters reside in their respective hubs, Batcave and Arkham Asylum. Each character has his or her unique abilities, such as special weapons, double jumps, mind control or immunity to certain attacks. The player can also change the suits of the characters to use their specific effects. For example, a Glide suit allows Batman to fly short distances, while Robin can use Magnet suit to climb metal surfaces. Since it\u2019s a LEGO game, the player will also have to build certain constructions from LEGO bricks.</p>"

This edition also includes a copy of the original Doom in its Ultimate version.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The plot is identical to Doom 3. The game is set on Mars in the 22nd century. The player controls a nameless space marine (nicknamed &quot;Doomguy&quot; by the fans). His task is to defeat the demons of Hell that invaded the Delta Labs research facility. Doom 3 features the series&#39; trademark violence, monsters, and black humor.</p>\n<h3>Expansion packs</h3>\n<p>BFG Edition includes two expansion packs. The Resurrection of Evil was previously released in 2005. The plot, set two years after Doom 3, follows a team that comes to a space station and discovers the hellish Artifact. This expansion introduces new weapons, such as The Grabber and the double-barreled shotgun, as well as additional multiplayer maps.</p>\n<p>The Lost Mission is a new story expansion that was not previously released. It allows you to play as a marine from the Bravo squad that was only mentioned in the original Doom 3. The protagonist&#39;s goal is to descend into Hell to find and destroy a teleportation device that demons are going to use to invade Earth.</p>"

Instead, they are released from the prison by a gang that believes Kane stole its money. The gang has Kane\u2019s family as hostages and wants the money back. Kane, Lynch, and other criminals they will hire have to gather the required sum by robbing banks, kidnapping people for ransom, and completing other criminal tasks. Gameplay in Kane &amp; Lynch is slightly reminiscent of GTA series with its third-person cop-shooting massacres. However, instead of the open world, there are consecutive levels with a mission in each, like in Hitman series (which was made by the same studio). <br />\nIn the story mode, Kane is the only protagonist under the player\u2019s control. Lynch and other members of the gang are AI-controlled, though Kane can order them to move, follow, or attack. In the co-op mode, the other player can assume the role of Lynch. Playing for him is a little different because Lynch is a psychopath who sees hallucinations. There\u2019s also an online multiplayer mode called Fragile Alliance that includes several new maps. In this mode, the team of players tries to survive the police assault and reach their getaway car.</p>"

The main task is to avoid collision with hexagon limits. The position of the limits varies depending on the difficulty level. The game is considered complete after player survives for 60 seconds. Everything moves with incredible speed and the task to keep up is not a simple one. The game increases the difficulty depending on how long the player lasted.</p>\n<p>The atmosphere of the game is already aggressive, there is a lack of an easy level of difficulty and rhythmic music and a constant screen-flickering. The combination will wake anyone. Initially, the game was released for mobile devices, after it was ported to the PC.</p>"

They are being used as test subjects on a PTi Industries factory. But now one brave clone learned his real purpose and is going to escape to freedom. <br />\nGameplay in Stealth Inc. 2 is centered around stealth action, for which the game was even compared to the Splinter Cell series despite huge stylistic differences. The clone has to move swiftly and silently to avoid security cameras and sentry robots. Its time is limited, however, and the player has to find the balance between speed and safety. Level design in Stealth Inc. 2 reminds of Metroidvania-style platformers. The factory is split into areas, consisting of eight test chambers each, all of them interconnected in the manner called overworld. The player will have to solve puzzles to open new areas. Every area introduces a gadget that should be equipped and is essential to use to move forward. Some of the puzzles are deadly traps that are only solved through trial and error. On the first walkthrough, they will almost inevitably kill the clone and send it back to the checkpoint.</p>"

His job is to collect the evidence, such as fingerprints and fluids, and send it to the FBI forensic laboratory to find clues to the mystery. Thomas will use the information he gathered to solve puzzles and access new territories of the fictional Metro City. His goal is to track down the murderer who is likely a famous serial killer. The job proves to be dangerous, as Thomas has to visit some of the darker places in the town and fight thugs and psychos, while the main villain seems to keep an eye on him.<br />\nThe combat system in Condemned: Criminal Origins is more realistic than in most first-person shooters. Here, firearms are able to kill people in one hit, however, they are seldom used, and the ammunition is very scarce. Ethan Thomas mostly uses improvised weapons, like shovels, wrenches and even a mannequin arm. Melee weapons also allow you to block enemy hits, and mastering timely blocks is essential to avoid being killed.</p>"

While making relationship choices throughout the daytime, Vinet is forced to participate in realistic nightmares at night. The setting of a title is two narratives folded one into another: on the outer layer, the game has TV-Show &quot;The Midnight Versus&quot; which tells the story of an inner layer \u2014 the adventures of &quot;Catherine&quot; world.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gaming process consists of two stages, according to the protagonist&#39;s activities. While the ventures during the day resemble the usual visual novel mechanics: walking, listening to dialogues and watching cinematics pieces, the action gameplay reveals itself in the night. There Vincent has to climb a set of stairs by removing and climbing blocks to avoid traps. If he fails \u2014 the protagonist dies in real life.</p>\n<h3>Reception</h3>\n<p>The game journalists generally liked the game but were disappointed by the sexists and misogynistic stories found within it. The title obtained commercial success, and thus there is a remaster coming out for PS4 and Vita. The remaster was half-ready in late 2017.</p>"

The game is the first in the group to have a non-linear structure with the protagonist returning to the previously visited areas and opening hidden paths with the new tools acquired along the way. <br />\nThe fighting system presents wielding two weapons at a time with the latter being divided into two main categories: melee \u2014 primary weapons and throwable \u2014 secondary ones. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The events depicted in the game take place seven years after the previous game in the series \u2014 The Sands of Time. The narrative centers around the antagonism of the protagonist of The Prince and Dahaka \u2014 the mystical beast, hunting him because he released the Sands of Time in the previous installment. <br />\nThe game features two endings: a canonical &quot;good&quot; one the storyline of which is transferred in the next chapter of The Prince&#39;s journey and the &quot;bad&quot; one. The difference lies in the Water Sword achievable through gathering all the collectibles for upgrading the life meter.</p>"

Starting with nothing, but simple clothes, flair, and a rug, players will have to scavenge for items, transport, and weapons, while running away from either zeds, bandits or hostile players.<br />\nDayZ can be played as a single player game, but most of the current player base is using multiplayer servers in order to form groups, clans and survive together.  In order to make the survival aspect more realistic, aside from thirst and hunger, several diseases have been added to the game, with specific cures for each effect. The game supports text and voice chat for communication, with a system that allows not only for a player-run radio station but secure two-way radio, without nearby players to hear it.</p>"

The game takes place 20 years after an apocalyptic event called Crossout. In 2027 a viral disease pandemic swept across the Earth, driving most people insane. Some committed suicide, some died when nuclear bombs were set off. Many of the survivors have mutated, became aggressive and formed gangs to patrol the wasteland on their hand-made vehicles.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player has to fight enemy characters (in PvE modes) and other players (in PvP battles) using armored cars. Victories increase the player&#39;s reputation and allow him or her to join various factions and craft their deadly weapons. There are missions the player can complete to earn more fame, money, and spare parts to customize his or her car. The game features advanced damage model, which means that any part of a vehicle can be shot off during a battle. For example a player can lose all wheels and get his car immobilized.</p>\n<h3>Customization</h3>\n<p>The game offers a variety of options for customization. Every player can assemble his or her unique car from scratch from dozens of spare parts. The cabin and the frame are the only two obligatory parts, the rest is up to the player. He or she can enhance the vehicle with weapons, armor, accelerators and other devices to fit his or her driving style. However, the design has to be practical and balanced at least to some extent. Awkwardly built vehicles can lose control or flip over. The blueprints of crafted vehicles can be shared on the &#39;Exhibition&#39;, where players can like and download them, to create a similar car or improve the original design. Game also offers automatic vehicle craft system, which will build a battle machine from the parts in player&#39;s storage.</p>"

There are 12 mech models, and each of them has its own unique characteristics: while the first ones are faster, the second are stealthier, and the third are stronger. Additionally, every mech has a special ability. You can choose the robot that fits your playstyle - or try them all one by one. \u00a0<br />\n Mechs can be upgraded with experience points, gained during battles, or with modules and gadgets, you can buy in stores. While the experience develops passive initials characteristics, gadgets work as boosts and additional abilities. \u00a0<br />\nMaps in these game deserve special attention as they are not flat and linear - instead, each of them has several levels to demonstrate mechs\u2019 ability to jump and fly. Map design is another challenge for you along with the development as it needs you to be careful and quickly respond to your opponents\u2019 moves and attacks.</p>"

Hiding from the Illuminati in Costa Rica, Ben starts to experience augmentation rejection syndrome because of a global shortage of Neuropozyne which suppresses the symptoms. Ben unravels a global conspiracy revolving around the drug and tries to warn the World Health Organization.</p>\n<p>Like the previous installments, the game features a high degree of role-playing. Players are able to upgrade their augmentations, unlocking more and more abilities. An inventory system is also present. Players have the option to use lethal or non-lethal approaches using different takedowns, and a wide range of weaponry. The levels are fairly open-ended so it is possible to complete a mission without even confronting the enemies.</p>"

        "description": "<p>The first game in the Divinity franchise introduces the player to the medieval high fantasy world of Rivellon aka Land of Divinity. There\u2019s an extensive backstory of the setting in the game. Rivellon is a troubled place torn by wars and rebellions and threatened by the awakening forces of Chaos. The protagonist starts his journey in the city of Aleroth. His or her first mission is to save the city\u2019s chief healer who was cursed into madness by an evil wizard. After that, the protagonist is free to explore the world and accept a variety of side quests from NPCs.</p>\n<p>The main character is fully customizable. At the start, the player is allowed to choose between six characters, who are male and female versions of the same three classes (Warrior, Mage, and Survivor). Each class has its own set of skills and attributes. However, over the course of the game, the character can learn virtually any skill regardless of his or her class. The game is played from an isometric view using point-and-click controls, thus being quite similar to the Diablo series. Unlike Diablo, it has a stronger leaning towards the classic RPG genre. Divine Divinity includes complex dialogue options, skill trees, and a reputation system.</p>\n<p>The game\u2019s soundtrack was composed by ex-Aria keyboardist Kirill Pokrovsky.</p>"

Construction will be the main mechanics, a lot of items will be in the game. Players can build and edit each wall of their Fort, build stairs, roof and windows, sculpting them according to a particular need. The terrain and map in the game are randomly generated, and players are given various ranged weapons (like a sniper rifle) as well as edged weapons (like a katana). You can also create weapons, and character skills can be customised through upgrades.</p>\n<p>The game features four different classes: ninja, alien, commando, and builder. Different classes have different abilities. For example, the builder builds faster and cheaper, and also strengthens the buildings themselves. And the ability to melee is much better in the ninja class than in other classes. Players can also destroy environment objects and scenery to get resources.</p>"

The player has to stick to the shadows during the missions, as running or walking will alert the guards who will come looking for Garett. </p>\n<p>The levels are fairly open-ended and have different paths for the player to choose from.

There&#39;ll be less creativity with the gameplay and instead I want to experiment with the rendering, story, and a few technical features. Right now I have only a rough idea about the narrative. I&#39;m hoping to capture a compelling mystery with suspense and twists in the limited space of an old merchant sailing ship. It won&#39;t be the typical &quot;collect items and look for clues&quot; structure. There&#39;s a slightly cool gameplay hook but I won&#39;t go into details on that until much later.</p>\n<p>Devlog</p>\n<p>I&#39;ll try to keep this (https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=40832.0) devlog lively as I make progress. Because the gameplay itself is more standard, there probably won&#39;t be as many creative updates as the Papers Please devlog. I will post lots of pictures and builds as soon as I&#39;m able. Things will likely also move slower than Papers Please did too, at least at the start. P,P still takes a good amount of my time so there&#39;s less chance for me to maintain a laser-like focus on one project like last time. The lower bound for finishing this game is around 3 months but realistically I think it&#39;ll take me around half a year. My Maya skills are pretty rusty so I expect the modeling/animation to take the most time.</p>\n<p>1-bit Rendering</p>\n<p>My first computer was a Mac Plus. I&#39;ve always had a nostalgia-softened spot in my heart for 1-bit graphics. I&#39;d like to capture the detailed black &amp; white look of old Mac games in a realtime 1st person game. I plan to push it grittier and less cartoon-like than those old games; the hard part will be keeping everything legible without it becoming an unreadable mess of dithered pixels. One interesting problem with 1-bit rendering is that it doesn&#39;t scale well for images and it compresses to video like shit - so YouTube stuff may look really poor. We&#39;ll see how it goes.</p>\n<p>Unity 3D</p>\n<p>I&#39;m gonna use Unity for this one. I fell in love with Haxe/OpenFL on my last project but unfortunately the 3D situation is not that great there yet. Also, it&#39;s time to finally see why 90% of the indie scene is using Unity. I have a good amount of experience with 3D games and the few days I&#39;ve played around with Unity so far have been pretty productive. The animated title screen scene up there (with post-processing shaders and all) was created in one day. I now have unrealistically high hopes.</p>"

It is best known and somewhat infamous for its uncanny violence, cynical black humor, and a highly controversial theme. The game offers the player to &quot;go postal&quot; on a spree shooting across the city.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The player controls the protagonist, nicknamed The Postal Dude: a homeless middle-aged man who apparently goes crazy and hears disembodied voices. He believes in a conspiracy theory that US government has poisoned his hometown with a nerve agent, and he&#39;s the only sane person around. He tries to eliminate the crowd he considers &quot;infected&quot;. His goal is to fight his way to the US Air Force base which he believes is responsible for the presumed attack.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Unlike its better-known sequel, POSTAL is 2D and uses top-down and isometric views. On each level, the player has to kill a specified share of enemies: civilians, military, and police alike. When this goal is complete, the door to the next level will appear. The player can complete the level even if The Postal Dude is killed, as long as the number of his own kills is satisfactory. The character can carry up to 8 types of weapons with varying strength and ammo limit. His basic gun is the weakest but has indefinite ammo supply.</p>\n<h3>Expansions and adaptations</h3>\n<p>There&#39;s an expansion pack Special Delivery that adds more levels and characters. In 2016, the game was remastered and re-released as Postal Redux. The game was unsuccessfully adapted to film by Uwe Boll.</p>"

It is inspired by the Mad Max movie series.</p>\n<h3>Plot and setting</h3>\n<p>The game is set in 2165, thirty years after the events of the original Rage. More than a century before that, the Apophis asteroid fell on Earth, causing mass destruction and driving humanity to near-extinction. The few remaining people hide in the few safe oases, while the rest of the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland raided by gangsters and evil mutants. The main protagonist is a man named Walker, who is the last ranger of the wasteland and a wielder of superhuman powers. He fights against the totalitarian organization called The Authority.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Like in the original RAGE, the sequel emphasizes its over-the-top action. The player controls Walker from the first person view and uses his huge guns and other weapons to fight monsters. The protagonist can also drive any vehicle that can be found in the game and engage in vehicular battles. When the player is driving, the game switches to the third person view. A new feature introduced in RAGE 2 is its Overdrive system that encourages aggressive playing style. By killing multiple enemies in a short amount of time, the player can enter Overdrive mode, which increases the guns&#39; power and the amount of loot. There is also a multiplayer mode.</p>"

Its setting is reminiscent of EVE Online, however, the gameplay has more in common with DOTA or World of Tanks. You are in full control of your ship, which is an enormous, multi-kilometer battlecruiser. However, you are also a part of a larger Starfleet, so you have to complete the mission objectives to win. Each battle is fought on a map that features the player&#39;s and enemies&#39; bases on the opposite edges, as well as Forward Bases and Gamma Sector in between. Battleships are able to jump between the sectors of a map using hyperspace tunnels.</p>\n<p>Between the battles, you can purchase and upgrade new spaceships. The game is free-to-play, so the resources can be either earned in the game itself or with microtransactions. Every ship has virtual crew members that you can hire and take five of them with you to the battle. Depending on their specialization, be it Engineering, Navigation, Repair, or something else, they provide your ship with specific bonuses. They will also advise you and overall act as if they were real people.</p>"

You decide the combat role you want to assume in the world of Brink as you fight to save yourself and mankind\u2019s last refuge. Brink offers a compelling mix of dynamic battlefields, extensive customization options, and an innovative control system that will keep you coming back for more.<br />\nBrink takes place on the Ark, a man-made floating city that is on the brink of all-out civil war. Originally built as an experimental, self-sufficient and 100% \u201cgreen\u201d habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth\u2019s oceans has forced the Ark to become home to not only the original founders and their descendants but also to thousands of refugees. With tensions between the two groups growing, Security and Resistance forces are locked in a heated battle for control of the Ark. Which side will you choose?</p>\n<p>KEY FEATURES:                                           Not Just Another Hero \u2013 Brink&#39;s advanced player customization offers a near-endless combination of looks for your character \u2013 allowing for the appearance of your character to be truly unique.  As you progress through the game and acquire more experience, you\u2019ll have even more opportunities for customization.<br />\nTwo Sides to Every Story \u2013 Choose to fight through the single player campaign as either a member of the Resistance or the Security and then take your same character online to play cooperatively or competitively against other players.<br />\nBlurring the Lines \u2013 Take your unique character online at any time you choose!  Brink allows you to seamlessly move between your single player campaign, co-op with friends, and intense multiplayer action. Multiplayer takes the story online where you can play with up to seven other people (or AI characters) cooperatively as you take on the opposing faction or with up to 16 players competitively.<br />\nPlay SMART \u2013 Brink uses the familiar shooter controls that you\u2019re used to, without frustrating, artificial constraints and adds a new feature: the SMART button.  When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where you\u2019re trying to get to, and makes it happen. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned FPS veteran or someone just getting started, you\u2019ll be able to make more intelligent decisions during the fast-paced action with SMART.<br />\nContext-Sensitive Goals and Rewards - Objectives, communications, missions, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based on your role, your condition, your location, your squad-mates, and the overall status of the battle in all gameplay modes.

The dungeons are filled with intricate traps to evade, puzzles to solve, and hungry monsters to fight in real-time mode. <br />\nLegend of Grimrock has a strong old-school dungeon crawler feel to it, and its creators proudly admit that they were inspired by the traditional first-person RPGs like Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder. The player assumes control over a party of four customizable characters that are divided into three traditional D&amp;D classes (fighter, rogue, and mage) and four quite non-traditional races (besides Human, there are Minotaur, Lizardman, and Insectoid). </p>\n<p>There&#39;s a bit of Portal to Legend of Grimrock, in that the prisoners are instructed by a disembodied and unreliable voice that promises them a cheerful party if they make it through the dungeon. Your party can also stumble upon records left by a previous prisoner, Toorum, which don&#39;t really inspire hope. There&#39;s an achievement that unlocks Toorum as a playable character.</p>"

After getting banished by the society, the main character finds himself all alone. Three exiles soon approach him and invite the protagonist to party with them and nickname him the Reader. The group sets out to cleanse their souls.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay of Pyre revolves around some sports game, which is connected with a ritual known as the Rites, which happens in a parallel world. The Protagonist controls his three newly found friends in battles against three opponents on a small arena. Each team has its own pyre. Both pyres oppose each other. The objective of the game is to defend your pyre while attacking the enemy one. The player can only destroy the pyre with the orb, that is spawned in the center of the arena and which has to be grabbed and thrown into the pyre.</p>\n<p>During a round, the Reader can switch between the character he wants to control and pass the orb from one to another. Each player has their own amount of endurance which is required for moving around the arena. If the players of a team come together, they create a zone that is dangerous for the player that carries the orb. If the player with the orb should get into that zone, they&#39;ll be temporarily removed from the game.</p>\n<p>While free from the Rites, the player can travel through the world of Pyre, train his teammates or try to learn more about the Rites.</p>"

There are eighteen playable civilizations in the game with some of them having multiple leaders to choose from. Each PC-controlled leader is based on an actual historical figure and has his or her unique personality traits, such as being diplomatic or aggressive.</p>\n<p>Civilization IV was the first to introduce different religions rather than an abstract &quot;religion&quot; as a concept. There are seven available religions that can be founded during the game and spread across the map, increasing their founder&#39;s influence and boosting his citizens&#39; happiness. The fourth part also introduced the idea of Great People, such as scientists, artists, and prophets, who are also based on actual persons. Corruption mechanic was removed and replaced with expensive building maintenance. Barbarians, who used to be just random enemy units, now can build cities that, however, will not contact with the player via diplomacy and should only be eliminated.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Dark Souls II is the third installment in the well-known Souls series. It\u2019s a different game from all the others because of its directors. With Dark Souls II the main director and founder of Souls-like genre Hidetaka Miyazaki took place only as a supervisor of the project, leaving a place of the director of the game for two young video game designers Tomohiro Shibuya and Yui Tanimura. One could ask if the game is as good and beautiful as other past games in the Series and the answer would be that Dark Souls II is different yet deep and unforgiving as all the other titles in the series. The famous difficulty of previous games is still there but the world is much simpler yet connected and dangerous. Enemies still respond after death of a player but only about 15 times. After that they disappear forever. Boss battles are much simpler, this time focuses on many simpler bosses at a time instead of one powerful boss. <br />\nDark Souls II is one of those games which were painfully downgraded in a favor of hardware of consoles, that means that players got less graphically advanced version than promised. Yet the game is interesting and deep and it\u2019s definitely a must play for every Souls fan.</p>"

The series is inspired by the classic Bioware RPGs like Baldur&#39;s Gate and Neverwinter Nights, and some of the game\u2019s writers have previously worked on these titles.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Dragon Age II is set in the medieval world of Thedas, inhabited by mythological races like elves and dwarves. This high fantasy setting has a definitive &quot;Dark Ages&quot; atmosphere. The game continues the plot of Dragon Age: Origins, and the player can choose which ending of the original game to use as a backstory. The player assumes the role of a protagonist named Hawke. He or she is a human who had to flee from an invasion of the monsters called Darkspawns. Over the course of the game, Hawke eventually rises to power and influences the fate of the whole Thedas.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The main protagonist is fully customizable. The player can choose his or her first name, gender, appearance and character class. There are three classes available: mage, warrior, and rogue. The player controls not only Hawke but also his or her party that can include up to three companions at once. You can only control one character at a time, however, switching between them while leaving the rest to AI control. </p>\n<p>Dragon Age II introduced the dialogue wheel that was borrowed from the Mass Effect series. Dialogue options usually have a tone that defines how other characters perceive each line and, eventually, the protagonist&#39;s personality.</p>"

Only one of them is wearing the VR headset or actually interacts with the computer. He or she acts as the main defuser who has to deactivate the bomb. All other players assume the roles of the experts. Their task is to help the defuser by reading aloud a manual about bombs. The experts need to be either in the same room with the defuser or to contact him or her over an audio messenger. </p>\n<p>The defuser is the only player who can see the bomb. He or she has to describe it in details to other players. The experts, in turn, have to find the described blocks in their manuals and tell the defuser what to do to solve the puzzle. </p>\n<h3>Bombs as puzzles</h3>\n<p>The composition and other attributes of each bomb are randomly generated for each level, and the players can customize them. The bombs consist of individual blocks, which are puzzles on their own. Some of the blocks require regular attention from the defuser, while others can be disarmed once and for all. </p>\n<p>The time for each level is limited. When the countdown reaches the end, the bomb will explode. Defuser&#39;s errors may also speed up the countdown or even activate the bomb and &quot;kill&quot; him or her. Each bomb has its own limit of time and errors.</p>"

No one has ever seen Kyros, but he spent four centuries uniting all the realms under his reign. Kyros rules through his powerful viceroys, the Archons, who, in turn, command their minions called Fatebinders. The protagonist is one of Fatebinders at Kyros&#39; service. He or she is sent to the Tiers province that is torn by the conflict. Two of the Kyros&#39; armies fight each other, and it slows down the conquest. The protagonist has to stop the conflict or to be executed.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player has to create the main character from scratch and define his or her abilities. The game has no character classes, and the character skills are individual. The process of customization also includes several questions about the character&#39;s background. The answers define how the character is perceived by the others and which factions he or she may join. The factions also influence the main character&#39;s abilities and the companions the player can recruit. </p>\n<p>Like in Pillars of Eternity, the player has to make difficult decisions that strongly influence the plot and the lives of NPCs. Every dialogue option may lead to a dramatically different outcome.</p>"

The game bears some resemblance to Tetris with the difference being the objective to stack the blocks instead of clearing rows of them. The rows do not disappear. The game is physics-based, so the player can&#39;t win by just dropping the blocks in a random manner. Several in-game events are present, for example, the blocks may drop faster or become slippery. Sometimes the blocks even double in size. You play as a wizard that competes against other wizards and has to build his tower as tall and stable as possible. </p>\n<p>It is possible to cast spells that either assist the players or make the building harder for other wizzards. The players can use 17 spells Throughout a match. Light magic spells are used for making the gameplay easier for the player while Dark magic spells make it harder for your opponents to progress. </p>\n<p>Three game modes are present: Race, Puzzle, and Survival. A handful of single-player challenges is also available where the player has to meet certain game conditions to succeed.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Space Engineers is a game about exploring planets, building spaceships and stations, and mining resources from asteroids. It was a precursor of sorts to No Man\u2019s Sky. The player explores worlds and systems that are based on the settings and options selected by the player; for example, the use of procedural generation, the speed of processes, and the hostility of the environment. Space Engineers allows a lot of options for customization, and the game\u2019s code is open source, making it popular among modders.<br />\nThe player assumes control over the human protagonist in a space suit and, at some stages of the game, an exploration ship (with options for both first and third person view). The player can build a variety of structures using different types of blocks and tools. Available structures include ships, planetary outposts, and space stations. <br />\nThe game includes a campaign and a set of standalone scenarios. Each of the scenarios, in turn, can be played in \u201cCreative\u201d or \u201cSurvival\u201d mode. The former is an easy sandbox in which the player is not limited in resources and cannot die. The latter requires the player to mine resources and to keep track of the main character\u2019s health and oxygen level. The game\u2019s graphics are based on voxels (3D pixels), though, unlike some other voxel-based games, it doesn\u2019t look like pixel art.</p>"

The higher your rank becomes, the more cars become available.\u00a0\u00a0<br />\nWhile DiRT 3 and the series in general is famous for its responsive controls and simple physics that make these games easy to master for newcomers, DiRT 3 features a quite challenging new mode - gymkhana. In this mode, you need to perform different tricks in a limited time period, such as drifting, jumping or spinning around. Gymkhana rounds are unskippable to progress in the career mode. Another key feature that highlights DiRT 3 is flashbacks - the mechanics that allows turning back time if you made a mistake during the race and driving a certain piece of the track again.</p>"

        "description": "<p>RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller. Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune.<br />\nYou begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world.<br />\nManage colonists&#39; moods, needs, wounds, and illnesses.<br />\nFashion structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, or futuristic materials.<br />\nTame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts.<br />\nWatch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses.<br />\nFight pirate raiders, hostile tribes, rampaging animals, giant tunnelling insects and ancient killing machines.<br />\nTrade with passing ships and trade caravans.<br />\nDecorate your colony to make it into a pleasurable space.<br />\nDig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires.<br />\nCapture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery.<br />\nDiscover a new generated world each time you play.<br />\nBuild colonies in the desert, jungle, tundra, and more.<br />\nLearn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor.<br />\nRimWorld is a story generator. It\u2019s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the \u201crandom\u201d events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.<br />\nYour colonists are not professional settlers \u2013 they\u2019re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You\u2019ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.<br />\nEach person\u2019s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill \u2013 but he does that very well.<br />\nColonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they&#39;ll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.<br />\nThe game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert plain, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.<br />\nYou can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.<br />\nPeople in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they&#39;re too stressed, they might lash out or break down.<br />\nWounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters&#39; capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer&#39;s leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino&#39;s horn, and it&#39;s much less dangerous.<br />\nYou can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he&#39;ll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.<br />\nAnd there&#39;s much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active mod community.

        "description": "<p>Europa Universalis IV is a global strategy game developed by Paradox Interactive. It is the fifth game in the series, not counting the add-ons.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game can take place at any time starting from the late Middle Age to the Napolean Wars era. The player can control any country there is in the game. It is possible to choose any starting date from November 11th, 1444 to January 1st, 1821.</p>\n<p>The player controls every aspect of life in his country. Diplomacy, religion (with each religion having its own development system), trading, science, and exploring the new lands (such as the Americas, Africa, and Australia). The player also has the country&#39;s military under their control. Every aspect of that time&#39;s society falls totally under the control of the player. You can build a new colonial superpower, become a dictator, establish a total dictatorship, or create a prosperous, democratic trade empire. </p>\n<p>There is no clear objective in the game. Instead, it is set by the player. However, the developers try to guide the player into playing certain scenarios by using the in-game achievement system. For example, one of the game&#39;s achievements is to unite Italy.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to transfer the progress from another game made by Paradox Interactive, Crusader Kings 2, to Europa Universalis IV.</p>"

The ultimate goal for the player is to remain the last one sitting behind the table.

Your village was attacked by an Evil Samurai Warlord, who uses magic to turn the innocent animals into his loyal soldiers. There\u2019s no killing and no blood; defeating your enemies will only make them disappear and return to their natural shape. <br />\nThere are six playable characters, although Hiro is the default protagonist. Each of the ninjas has different skills and weapons. Some of the characters can use stealth to avoid the battle or to perform a wall-jump. There are also spells that allow you to fire lightning bolts at your opponents or to turn you into an animal for camouflage and sneaking. <br />\nThe game is full of visual staples about East Asia, such as traditional Japanese lanterns and hats, architecture, bamboo groves, pandas, masked ninjas, and armored samurai. The \u201cchibi\u201d (baby-like) design of the characters, along with their comically high-pitched voices, make all these look like a light-hearted parody rather than actual stereotypes. There are also elements of Japanese mythology such as Tengu, the friendly magic bird people, who trade with the character, provide training, and offer quests.</p>"

This part of the series has street racing as its main theme. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game includes 34 cars divided by three types: &quot;derby&quot;, &quot;race&quot; and &quot;street&quot;. As the player&#39;s career progresses, he or she can unlock more cars that include everything up to school buses. Each car has its unique characteristics and may require different driving styles. The player can also upgrade his or her existing vehicle instead of purchasing a new one.</p>\n<p>In the career mode, the game includes more than 30 tracks with varied environment and length. The levels often allow more than one route to choose from at any lap. AI-controlled opponents have personalities that define their driving style. Besides the races, there are mini-games that offer the player to perform stunts.</p>\n<h3>Differences from the original game</h3>\n<p>Compared to the first part, the sequel doubled on the number of available cars, tracks, and mini-games. FlatOut 2 also introduced longer tournaments and online multiplayer. There&#39;s also an improved physics engine. The tire grip was enhanced, making the controls more sturdy, and the cars are now less likely to bounce off the track.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s also a ragdoll physics model that defines the movements of the driver within the car. After crashes and during the stunt mini-games the driver may even fly out of the car. In some mini-games, the goal is to throw the driver&#39;s body as far as possible or to land it on a designated target.</p>"

His home country is taken over by a military coup led by ruthless General Magnus, and Shank has no choice but to fight the regime&#39;s militia. There&#39;s also a second protagonist, Shank&#39;s childhood friend Corina. She can be played in several story missions, as well as in a newly introduced multiplayer survival mode. Corina&#39;s abilities are slightly different from that of Shank&#39;s, her moves are swifter, however, her attacks deal less damage.</p>\n<p>The game is played as a 2D side-scroller. To move forward, Shank and Corina have to defeat all enemies they encounter, using three types of weapons: piercing them with knives, smashing with a club or shooting with a gun. The weapons can be switched on a fly during the action, thus allowing a variety of combos. The gameplay has slightly changed since the original game: blocking is not allowed anymore, and dodging is the only option to evade damage. Like its predecessor, Shank 2 features a somewhat cartoonish visual style, that contrasts the quite bloody and grotesque action scenes.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Shank, the first game in the series of its name, is defined by its comic-book visual style and graphic violence in the vein of Tarantino and Rodriguez movies. In the single-player mode, the game follows a story of a revenge. The player assumes the control of Shank, who used to be a mafia hitman before they killed his only love, Eva. He goes on a vendetta after her murderers, hunting them down and killing in brutal ways. There&#39;s also a cooperative mode that features a different plot, something of a prequel to the main storyline. In co-op, Shank and the other playable character, Falcone, have to save a strip model from a gang of bikers and fix a rigged wrestling match.<br />\nThe game is played as a fast-paced 2D side-scroller. Shank uses three types of weapons: a firearm, a melee weapon, such as a chainsaw, and two daggers. All three should be used interchangeably to create a variety of combo movements, which are essential to master before you reach the late stages of the game. Enemy attacks can be dodged or blocked. Shank can also perform a number of acrobatic tricks and other movements, such as throwing enemies or jumping on them, which makes for a varied gameplay.</p>"

Kaileena gets kidnapped, and The Prince sets out to find her. It is also revealed, that by altering his own fate, The Prince prevented the creation of the Sands of Time from ever happening, so the timeline changes. It is your job to fix it back up.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay of The Two Thrones is closer to the first installment in the franchise - the acrobatics play an important role. The combat system is almost the same as it was in the second game. The player still has two weapons (one main and one temporary) and can perform combos. For the first time in the series, the Prince does not have his swords, and a dagger is used instead (replaced with the Dagger of Time later). The temporary weapons now have a certain amount of damage they can sustain. </p>\n<p>The Prince can now transform into a Dark Prince, whose health goes down quickly, but can be instantly regenerated with sand. Dark Prince&#39;s gameplay changes drastically as it encourages fast-paced combat without relying much on tactics. However, all the transformations happen strictly on plot occasions.</p>"

The Third Echelon got disbanded, and Sam Fischer became a private security contractor. A terrorist organization known as The Engineers threatens the United States with a series of terrorist attacks if the U.S. Military will not call off their troops stationed in other countries. POTUS comes to Fischer, forms the Fourth Echelon and grants Sam with a Fifth Freedom - the freedom to defend the four first freedoms no matter what it takes.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Splinter Cell Blacklist focuses on a stealth mission approach. The player is still free to go in loud, but it will be much harder, as Fischer can sustain a very small amount of damage even on the lowest difficulty.</p>\n<p>The players have a wide range of gadgets at their disposal, such as the snake cam, a throwable sticky camera that can distract enemies, a portable EMP, and a variety of grenades. It is also possible to upgrade Fisher&#39;s outfit, making it more stealthy or improve its armor. The players can also upgrade their HQ to gain certain advantages on the battlefield, such as an improved minimap.</p>\n<p>The game evaluates the players&#39; performance. Three play styles are available - Ghost, a complete stealth approach with no kills; Panther - a stealthy approach with enemy kills; Assault - a head-on gunfight with the enemies.</p>"

It lets you see how all the security devices in a level are wired up, and then you can just click and drag with the mouse to wire them differently. So you can connect a lightswitch to a trapdoor, then flick it when a guard walks across to make him fall through.Key Features Rewire levels to work however you want<br />\nTrick guards into trapping themselves or shooting each other<br />\nThrow yourself - and others - through plate glass windows<br />\nInvestigate a noir-inspired story of murder and espionage over 20 missions<br />\nChoose what to tell your clients, including lying to trick them<br />\nChoose your own playstyle: quick, quiet, non-violent, no living witnesses, or any combination<br />\nDiscover new solutions to levels that no-one else has thought of<br />\nBuy specialist gadgets to suit how you want to play<br />\nAll story stuff is skippable<br />\nHardest puzzles are optional<br />\nNo bosses - everyone dies in one shot, including you</p>"

Your goal is to become a great sportsman and win a tournament, but also to investigate and avenge your father\u2019s death. The player controls his character around the clock, making him exercise, eat, go to the job, buy food and other items, and interact with other characters. <br />\nWorking out will improve the boxer\u2019s main characteristics, such as strength and stamina, moving him towards his goal. But there are also essential Sims-like attributes like hunger and happiness that wear down during activities and need to be replenished. Money is also essential and can be earned by performing jobs and quests or by winning boxing matches. Before each fight, be it a match or an assault by a street gang, you choose a number of skills that the boxer will use this time. Completing quests will earn you favors from the other characters that will help you to advance the central plot and find the murderer.</p>"

The plot is set in a fantasy world of Endoria, in the kingdom of Darion, and does not continue King\u2019s Bounty. The protagonist is a rookie hero who offers his services to Mark, the king of Darion, and is to become his Royal Treasure Searcher. The player\u2019s goal is to complete quests that will earn his or her character the titular king\u2019s bounty, be it gold or a rank in nobility. <br />\nUnlike the original TBS game, The Legend combines tactical gameplay with role-playing elements, such as character classes, experience, and a tree of skills. Your class (warrior, paladin, or magician) is assigned automatically based on your actions in the tutorial mission. There are also dialogues, character interaction, and even romance options than allow your character to marry and have children. The player explores the world\u2019s map in real time, like in most RPGs. The combat system, however, is completely different. During battles, the player controls not the hero, but the hero&#39;s units, the number of which depends on the character\u2019s \u201cLeadership\u201d. Battles are turn-based and are fought on a grid of hexagonal tiles, just like in the related Heroes of Might &amp; Magic series.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Dear Esther is a game that questions the very concept of a &quot;game&quot; as an entertainment. It is more of an art project that was originally started as a mod on the Source engine (the one Half-Life 2 is based on). The player assumes the role of a nameless and faceless character, a man, who wanders around a cold island at the shores of Scotland. When you enter certain parts of the island, the main character reads aloud his letters from the past, revealing his tragic story. All other characters, including the protagonists\u2019 wife Esther, are only mentioned by the narrator and do not appear in the game. There&#39;s very little actual gameplay, and your goal as a player is to explore the island and discover as many parts of the backstory as possible. The goal of the game is to follow the story, immerse yourself in the experience and pass it through your emotions.</p>\n<p>Dear Esther is famous for its visual design and sound: there are gorgeous natural landscapes (the caves in particular), ambient sounds, and music. Melancholic mood and darkened landscapes befit the story that is all about loss and grief.</p>"

In the beginning you can choose a driver and a car; their stats are quite similar with slight differences in speed and turning. To raise your tips you need to reach the destination on time. To earn extra money you can perform multiple tricks, including drifts, jumps, near-misses, and combos of these moves. </p>\n<p>Driving through the city isn\u2019t that easy as it seems to be. There are numerous obstacles in your way, such as frustratingly slowly buses, that make you take risks during your maneuvers on the road. Moreover, the amount of potential passengers is limited: once you pick up a person, it\u2019s unavailable for the rest of the game.</p>"

The game takes inspiration from the real Turing Test. The Turing test is a real test that the scientist Alan Turing suggested.

There is also an Ambush races mode, where players have to escape from the police as fast as possible. Like in the original Need for Speed: Most Wanted game, cops can start to pursue the player during the race and as well as in the original players have to compete against other racers and if succeeded they instantly get their cars. The game takes place in a regular city called Fairhaven, which has a beach and an industrial district as well as the main highway. <br />\nThe game was praised for those who are fans of Burnout series, especially because of its way of races where there is a start and finish of the race but players have an option to choose which way they want to go.</p>"

Enjoy a classic RPG experience inspired by games like Baldur&#39;s Gate, Fallout 1 and 2 and Arcanum. Explore and conquer the Stolen Lands and make them your kingdom!</p>\n<p>Based on our players&#39; feedback and suggestions, this version of the game improves and builds upon the original. This edition includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>numerous gameplay-enriching content additions and dozens of quality-of-life features  </li>\n<li>new abilities and ways to build your character, including a brand-new class  </li>\n<li>new items and weaponry  </li>\n<li>improved balance, especially in the beginning and last two chapters of the game  </li>\n<li>enhanced kingdom management system, both in terms of balance as well as usability and player comfort  </li>\n<li>increased variety of random encounters on the global map  </li>\n<li>thousands of fixes and improvements made since the game&#39;s initial release  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Explore the Stolen Lands, a region that has been contested territory for centuries: Hundreds of kingdoms have risen and fallen in these lands, and now it is time for you to make your mark\u2014by building your own kingdom! To do so, you\u2019ll need to survive the harsh wilderness and the threat of rival nations\u2026 as well as threats within your own court.</p>\n<p>Customize your character with a wide range of classes and powers including specialized archetypes, powerful arcane and divine spells, choosing from a multitude of class abilities, skills, and feats. Pathfinder allows players to create heroes (or villains) that fit both their individual gameplay styles and their personalities.</p>\n<p>Meet a diverse cast of companions and NPCs, including iconic characters from the Pathfinder setting itself. You\u2019ll need to decide who to trust and who to watch carefully, as each companion has an agenda, alignment, and goals that may differ from yours. Your journey will become their journey, and you\u2019ll help shape their lives both in the moment and well into the future.</p>\n<p>Conquer new regions as claim them as your own, carving your kingdom from the wilderness. While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and kingdom development are also part of the challenge. Choose your allies well, and keep them close while exploring ancient tombs and ruins \u2014 and while dealing with politics in your own court.</p>\n<p>Your kingdom is a reflection of your character and your choices throughout the game. It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with. As your kingdom grows, a number of factions and neighboring countries will come to you to seek favor\u2014and to test your strength.</p>\n<p><strong>Explore - Conquer - Rule!</strong></p>\n<p>The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is an evolution of the 3.5 rules set of the world&#39;s oldest fantasy roleplaying game, designed by Paizo, Inc using the feedback of tens of thousands of gamers just like you. Whether you\u2019re new to the Pathfinder\u00ae universe or you\u2019re a seasoned veteran, Pathfinder: Kingmaker is the CRPG you\u2019ve been waiting for.</p>"

After the tutorial, you can choose one of three maps to explore.<br />\nThe goal of the game is to clear the maps from Plague Hearts \u2013 sources of Blood Plague disease that makes zombies more aggressive and dangerous. The world is entirely free to explore. Throughout it, you come across survivor\u2019s bases that you can upgrade with different facilities such as kitchens, gardens, workshops and many more. During the game you are also going to meet new survivors, that would join you and become playable. Each survivor has its progression system with numerous stats to upgrade and abilities to unlock. The death in the game is permanent for every survivor. The game offers many unique items and weapons, both ranged and melee, to fight zombies and hostile survivors. The ammunition for firearms is limited therefore frequently it\u2019s better for players to avoid combat and use stealth and distraction items rather than brute force. One of the game\u2019s most notable features is the full-fledged cooperative multiplayer support that allows groups of up to four players to go through the entire game.</p>"

These beams create tunnels without gravity that help to come over obstacles, solve puzzles and even fight enemies. More items become available on higher levels. The game only supports co-op on the same console, with no online multiplayer.<br />\nWhile Pid has really hardcore gameplay, its visual style is calm and relaxing. The in-game world is full of secrets and collectibles that balance the gaming experience a little. Almost every NPC has something to tell you, so don&#39;t ignore dialogues that will shed some light on Pid&#39;s lore.</p>"

Each accident occurs in slow-mo, and the camera hangs in the most exciting angles. In Paradise there are two types of damage: if all wheels are in place and the suspension is not damaged, then the player can continue the race despite the damage. If the player loses one of the wheels - a car is considered wrecked and player respawns. Also, all cars react realistically to all collisions: scratches and dents appear on the body, the body twists abreast solid objects impacts.</p>\n<p>Players can both go through the game alone in a single campaign, and compete in multiplayer races. It adds new modes such as Cops and Robbers.</p>"

This time, however, it is revealed that our heroes&#39; nemesis is back for more, with new allies and new soldiers to try and stop the protagonists. As the levels progress, the player faces different enemies, each with unique patterns and abilities, and also finds new weapons and upgrades for his character of choice. Another feature of the series is its vehicles, including tanks, planes, helicopters and even a spaceship. Each of those can be used to the various extent and provide significant bonuses to character\u2019s firepower, defense, or movement capabilities.<br />\nThe game is made using pixel graphics, and even though it was initially released in 2000, the sceneries and the details are still as stunning. Each character\u2019s looks are refined, explosions are made colorful and as realistic for a 2D game as possible, and the locations themselves would look like art.</p>"

The game uses basics from the hack-and-slash genre, like its predecessor, and was developed by Santa Monica studio, which is a subsidiary of Sony Entertainment. The game is recognized as one of the best for the console from Sony and the best game in action genre in 2007. The game was released on Sony Playstation 2 already at the moment when the third version of the console was already selling for four months. The developers explained their decision: one hundred million people already playing on PlayStation 2, whereas on the next-generation console gamers were just going to adopt the new hardware.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The player controls Kratos, who in the first part killed the god of war Ares and took his place. The game heavily relies on the ancient Greek mythology and uses it as inspiration and the main source for enemies and NPC design as well as locations design. However, the game is not a great source of accurate historical facts: Ancient Greece history was rewritten for the sake of the genre and the game universe, the rules of which were established in the first part.</p>\n<h3>The story</h3>\n<p>King of the gods Zeus betrays Kratos and kills him, but the Spartan is saved from the Underworld by another goddess Gaia, who invites Kratos to find the Sisters of Fate and go to the past and prevent his own murder. The gameplay remained the same: the player can use several attacks, which can be combined and improved with the help of the in-game currency collected from enemies. The game has a lot of Quick-Time-Events, mostly they are used in battles with bosses and in finishing combo-moves. Bosses in the game, in comparison with the first part, significantly increased.</p>"

It is based on a 1984 board game Mutants.</p>\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n<p>The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world, in which a nuclear war annihilated all humanity. Many years later, Earth is inhabited by the mutated creatures that look like combinations of humans with other animals and things. There&#39;s The Ark, a neon-lit sinkhole that serves as the hub for the player characters. This is where they can buy ammunition and armor, meet other characters and accept quests. Then there&#39;s the Zone, a largely unexplored dangerous world where Mutants roam. Somewhere in the Zone lies the legendary Eden, a safe haven where they can find all the answers they seek.</p>\n<h3>Characters</h3>\n<p>The game has three main protagonists. First, there&#39;s Dux, the duck-headed wise-cracking mutant with an attitude. Then there&#39;s Bormin, a huge gruff pig that has anger issues. Their third companion is Selma, a seemingly human female who has protective stone skin. Each of the characters specializes in using certain weapons and has a set of special mutant abilities.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden combines real-time exploration and stealth system with square grid-bound tactical turn-based combat in the vein of X-Com series.

        "description": "<p>Set in the distant future, this science fiction strategy was inspired by Total Annihilation (1997) and is designed by one of the original game&#39;s engine creators, Jon Mavor. Planetary Annihilation gameplay is largely similar to classic RTS series like Starcraft or Command &amp; Conquer, yet not without its own unique features. This game is focused on interplanetary wars on a larger scale and allows its players to conquer the whole worlds or even destroy them using nukes and Death Star-like devices. The maps are randomly generated, and each map constitutes a whole planet in 3D projection (albeit scaled down). Each player starts with a Commander unit that is used to create necessary buildings. Commanders represent the player and, like in chess, loss of your Commander means losing the game.</p>\n<p>The definitive feature of the game is that battles are not contained to certain planets, but are fought across the whole planetary systems using missiles and &quot;planet thrusters&quot;; and there are many such systems in the galaxy. The scale of the setting can make it difficult to keep track of one&#39;s operations across different systems at the later stages of the game.</p>"

It has developed an odd social structure over the course of several generations. It could have quietly continued along its weird way, but a sudden outbreak of an unknown and inevitably lethal disease has decimated the citizens. Prayers did not help. Science did not help. So, finally, they have turned to outsiders for help: three of them enter the town in hope of finding a cure or\u2014failing that\u2014an explanation.

When it&#39;s the player&#39;s turn, he has to move his army anywhere on the map, while in combat, the player has to choose either to fight the battle or let the computer calculate the outcome. <br />\nThere are several single-player campaigns.In the short campaign the player has to defeat a few enemy factions and control as least 15 territories, while in longer campaign, the player has to control at least 45 territories and a gigantic city like Jarusalem, Granada, Rome or Constantinople.</p>"

        "description": "<h3>The succsessor</h3>\n<p>Prototype 2 - developed by Radical Entertainment is a science-fiction adventure shooter with a third-person view in the open world. The publisher was Activision, and the game was released on April 24, 2012, on PS3 and Xbox 360, and then, on July 24, 2012, on PC. Later, in August 2015, it was released on consoles of the next generation - PS4 and Xbox One.</p>\n<h3>The setting</h3>\n<p>The action takes place in a city called New York Zero, where an epidemic is raging, and its territory is divided into zones. The player will try on the role of Sergeant James Heller, who serves in the Middle East. It all begins at the moment when his wife calls and says that the epidemic has begun again in the city and they are at the epicenter with their daughter. Returning home, James discovers that his family is dead and now his task is to find someone who, in his opinion, is the culprit of these deaths.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>Cruel and bloody Prototype 2 is the second game of the series. It seems that, compared to the first part, the gory feel is becoming bigger. The game is allowing you to run and jump almost anywhere and do whatever the player wants - anarchy! But despite the fact that the game takes place in an open world, a player can feel some linearity of events. According to lead designer Matt Armstrong, this was done purposefully so that the player would feel the development of the storyline and wouldn\u2019t be afraid of too many options, and have the opportunity to open new territories gradually, thereby more effectively upgrading his character and immerse in the game\u2019s universe.</p>"

He jumps and slides to evade dangers, such as giant caterpillars, angry trees or soaring fireballs, and kicks to attack them. He has no hit points, and any hit means you have to restart the level again. Commander Video always runs, the player cannot stop or reverse the movement and is only able to make the character perform certain actions, such as jumps, at the necessary moments. <br />\nCommander Video&#39;s movements are perfectly synchronized to music. When movements are performed right, new notes are added to the game&#39;s chiptune music score. Even pushing an unassigned button will result in playing some musical sounds. The run becomes quicker with time, raising the game&#39;s difficulty, but also giving the player more control and influence over the soundtrack. The game&#39;s visual style is that of simple and colorful pixel art with a &quot;retro&quot; feel to it. There are three \u201cworlds\u201d in the game, each of them includes eleven levels and ending with a boss fight.</p>"

Mel was invited to participate in a test of Aperture Science Short Term Relaxation Vault. Mel arrives at the vault, gets into it and falls asleep. But something goes wrong and instead of several minutes, Mel sleeps for several decades. Upon coming to, she finds that the Aperture Science facility is devastated. Mel has to get out of there.</p>\n<p>The gameplay of the mod is not different from Portal 2&#39;s. The players solve puzzles using the portal gun which allows for opening two two-sided portals on suitable surfaces and moving different objects. Almost every object from Portal 2 is present in the mod with one new addition: water. It is used to extinguish a fire. The game consists of 22 puzzles and takes from 6 to 10 hours to complete.</p>"

Like all Sims game, it allows the player to control the life of a person or even a whole family.</p>\n<h3>Character creation</h3>\n<p>Before the main game starts, the player has to create his or her character, called sim. The player can choose to play as a single character or a family. The game allows full customization for each sim. The player chooses their gender, age, race, and body type, as well as their traits that influence the sim&#39;s in-game behavior. The traits help sims to learn new skills that will be useful in their job and social life. The player can also choose to set all settings to random. There are also settings that define if the sims will age, and how fast.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game introduces the open world that lives on its own even when the player doesn&#39;t interfere. Unlike in Sims 2, the world is seamless and there&#39;s no long load time when you travel it. The sims themselves became more independent and require less player attention to stay alive. Sims 3 is less oriented towards &quot;tamagotchi&quot;-like life-sustaining and more towards actually living the sims&#39; lives, such as going to work, attending parties, making friends and flirting. The sims will occasionally have wishes, and fulfilling them earns the character more happiness points.</p>\n<h3>Building homes</h3>\n<p>The building mode didn&#39;t change much since Sims 2, but the game introduced a few additional options. Most notably, elements don&#39;t have to be aligned to a grid anymore. The player can place them diagonally at any angle.</p>"

GameGuru is a recreational game maker, not a professional tool, and is still very much in development.  GameGuru is unsuitable for serious game development projects at this time, and we highly recommend you visit the forums and ask many questions before you make a decision on the game making tool for you.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "<p>Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is the third game in the series that was started by Giana Sisters, a 1987 platformer. The original game was a Super Mario rip-off, but, though the new game retained many of the old mechanics (such as defeating enemies by jumping on them), there are also novel gameplay ideas.<br />\nYou play as Giana, a girl who tries to rescue her sister Maria from the hands of an evil dragon Gurglewocky. Giana herself has two different personalities, a &quot;Cutie&quot; and a &quot;Punk&quot;, that can be switched during the game. This change also dramatically alters the environment, allowing the player to shift between two dream worlds: one is a brightly colored garden, while other is a dark, nightmarish forest of giant mushrooms. In both worlds, the levels are nearly identical, despite the aesthetic change. But sometimes the game may demand you to switch to another world to move forward or to obtain a powerup that only exists in one of the worlds.<br />\nA definitive feature of Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is its music. The score was composed by Chris Hulsbeck, who worked with the original Giana Sisters, and metal band Machinae Supremacy. The soundtrack shifts between \u201ctraditional\u201d and &quot;heavy&quot; versions of the same compositions to highlight the game&#39;s dual nature.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Hand of Fate is an unusual combination of various genres. It is based on mechanics typical for deck-building board games, but also features rogue-like and hack-and-slash elements. Its approach to the storytelling is typical for tabletop RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons. <br />\nYou play cards against the Dealer, who is both your DM, opponent, and narrator of your adventures. Each card represents an item, a character, or an encounter. You navigate your character through the story that unfurls as you reveal the cards and make your choices. The goal is to collect a powerful deck of cards that give your character better weapons, armor, and other equipment. You can unlock more cards after you defeat bosses and complete quests. The Dealer\u2019s goal is to hamper your progress, as he plays his cards to put new obstacles in your way.<br />\nMost of the time the game will only show you the cards and the Dealer who sits across the table from you. You will learn the events from listening to him and reading the text on cards. Battles, however, are actually fought in real time by animated characters on visualized 3D arenas. This is very unusual for board game simulators and brings some variety into the gameplay.</p>"

The main character, an elusive thief Garrett, is tasked with resolving a crisis brewing in the metropolitan City. Different factions fight for influence and schemes are put into action to undermine each other\u2019s plans. As the story progresses, the protagonist finds more clues about the mysterious prophecy that tells about the end of humanity and risks his own life to prevent it from fulfilling.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game heavily emphasizes discreteness and stealth, as the guards of the City may often try to stop the main character. Visibility and sounds play a crucial role in completing different tasks, and utilizing the surroundings can help get rid of enemies without confrontation. Different gadgets can be used to mask the sounds, obtain enemy\u2019s location, and snuff out the lights. However, the playable character can still use his weapons to get rid of pursuers, but on higher levels of difficulty, doing so ends up in defeat and the need to restart the mission.</p>\n<h3>Visuals and features</h3>\n<p>As with its predecessor, Thief II employs a refined AI system, where enemies can notice sudden changes in the environment and react correspondingly. The lighting and shadowing have also been revamped, albeit keeping the same noir mood to the locations. The graphics of the game are awe-inspiring for its year of release, as each texture is highly detailed, and physics are made to be life-comparable realistic.</p>"

Some 30 years ago, a woman named Jeyne Kassynder led the rebellion and took over the power in the fantasy realm of Ehb. Kassynder framed the heroic 10th Legion, featured in Dungeon Siege, for the murder of the king, and nearly annihilated them.<br />\nThe player takes the role of an heir to one of the last surviving Legion members. There are four possible protagonists with pre-scripted backstories to choose from, and the main plot will slightly differ based on your choice. However, regardless of which character you choose, the other three will eventually appear in the game and can be recruited to accompany the player, one at a time.<br />\nEach character has his or her unique set of skills and attacks. For example, Lucas, a knight, can withstand heavy damage in a melee fight. Katarina prefers ranged weapons and a little magic. Anjali is a shape-shifter who is a combination of both, depending on her current form, and Reinhart is a classic magician who uses energy spells. The controls are very different from the previous parts: the point-and-click approach was scrapped in favor of arrow keys and attack buttons.</p>"

And certainly his character was influenced by the fact that his father is Lucifer himself, who on the sixth day after birth informed the boy that he had prepared many gifts for him. But to get these gifts, the boy needs a little work. Namely - to finish off everyone who lives with the boy in the same house or just inappropriately appeared next to him. This is a lot of people - twenty. Most different, from butlers and gardeners to reporters, priests and police. Papa Lucifer did not make any special demands, he was soft with his son - he did not order any special methods of murder, he agreed to any. But life is unpredictable, and the boy had to often retreat from simple scenarios, acting very ingeniously. On the other hand, he already had some of the unusual gifts - for example, telekinesis, pyrokinesis, the ability to subordinate someone else&#39;s will.</p>"

However, the solution is sought precisely by turning over, rotating and other unusual, impossible actions with all this.</p>\n<p>48 puzzles await the hero throughout the game. Each puzzle has its own unique solution.</p>\n<p>After the hero passes the main story of the game, its alternative version will open. Alternative version includes alternative versions of half of the puzzles, 24 pieces.

And even worse - the scientist is expelled from the university. At the same time, the color discovered by this scientist is spreading in her one-color world. In punishment, the scientist is sent to another world - the world of impossible flowers. Impossible colors are those colors that are invisible to the human eye, they are outside the visible spectrum.</p>\n<p>The player plays for a little boy named Hue, who one morning wakes up and starts looking for eight visible \u0441olors to save the scientist from the world of invisible colors.</p>\n<h3>Game mechanics based on color</h3>\n<p>In the game, objects can be seen, but with them you can do something only if the color of these objects is different from the color of the game&#39;s background. For example, you start with a black background, and you can see a black door on a black background - you can see its outline. But you can open it only if you change its color to some other one. or if you change the background color. And you can change the background color only when you find, &quot;open&quot; some color. For example, the first color to open in the game is Aqua. After you open this color, you can make this color the background color of the game. And then the door will be black and you will be able to open it. This technique is used in many games - but usually it is implemented only for one color, for example, white on black or vice versa. In Hue, the player deals with eight colors - after the opening of each next color, the game is correspondingly more complicated.</p>\n<p>There are many objects in the game that you need to interact with in order to go further. And each object has to be made real by using the color mechanics described above. And also find a way to properly interact with the object itself. There are many puzzles in the game, and often they seem to be unresolved, but after the decision is finally found, the player is usually surprised how he could not see this decision from the very beginning.</p>\n<h3>The Mysteries of the Final</h3>\n<p>In addition to the fascinating mechanics, the game also has a story - a story about a woman researcher who discovered color for a one-color world. This story develops throughout the game, its fragments open gradually and in the end everything will turn into one picture.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Worms Revolution is a Team17 game and the 18th part of Worms series, counting as many as 25 titles total. It is the turn-based game with a heavy accent on customizable characters and environment. The game features single- and multiplayer while giving the players an opportunity to play in cooperative with the hotseat feature allowing them to take turns one at a time.<br />\nIt is hard to say that &quot;Worms&quot; has any plot at all: there is barely even hints, which may prompt the player to understand the eternal conflict between the worms of a different color. <br />\nThe gameplay, on the other hand, is quite memorable: in fact so crucial that not only Worms have given birth to many other worms-like games but also created a whole genre: artillery tactical turn-based strategy. The primary goal of a team or a player is to eliminate the opponent(s). To achieve this goal, one must utilize a various range of weapons. They do not only damage the other worms but also transform the ground. While every turn grants the player with the ability to walk a certain amount of space and utilize one weapon \u2014 the landscape factor is crucial here.</p>"

These conglomerates are the pioneers of space travel, space construction, and artificial intelligence development. The economy promoting loyalty to a select corporation is established. </p>\n<p>The game takes place on the Tacoma space station. It serves as a transit hub between Earth and a resort built upon Moon. Amy Ferrier is hired by the corporation that operates the station to investigate a mysterious chain of events occurred on the station and to retrieve a processing module from the station&#39;s artificial intelligence. Upon her arrival, Amy begins to find out what&#39;s going on using Tacoma&#39;s augmented reality system.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Tacoma focuses on the in-game world&#39;s exploration. There are no enemies present in the game, so the players can focus on the narrative aspect of it. </p>\n<p>The players utilize an augmented reality device found on the station to access its security footage and recreate the events that happened here. It is possible to manipulate the footage like a recording, fast-forwarding it, pausing and rewinding. The players can see the characters move from room to room, or in some cases follow the character&#39;s path. One of the main game&#39;s aspects is its puzzles, as it is the main thing the players will be doing for most of the time.</p>"

It is based on the Native American and Canadian folktales and prominently features mythological creatures like werewolves and wendigos. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game is set in Canada in the XIX century. The protagonists are two brothers O&#39;Carroll who set their differences aside to save their sister. Every night, a pack of werewolves and other monsters attack her house. If they fail, the Devil himself will abduct the poor woman. The brothers have to hold on for three weeks in the midst of December.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player assumes the role of one of the brothers and controls them from the top down view. The goal is to defend the house and other buildings. The game is divided into days and nights. By day, the player can prepare his or her defenses by setting traps. The protagonists have a limited number of action points and money to spend on the traps. The more buildings there are, the more action points the player has, but also the more difficult they are to protect.</p>\n<p>By night, the werewolf invasion puts the player&#39;s preparations to the test. Enemies come in waves by random numbers. However, the player has all important information about the strength of the opponents. The protagonist can fight the monsters directly using his axe and a musket. The latter is ranged but has limited ammo and a long loading time. The player can also intimidate the monsters so that they will not attack his or her character.</p>"

        "description": "<h3>The help from Kickstarter backers</h3>\n<p>This is a role-playing game with roguelike elements from the independent British studio Failbetter Games. The money was collected on Kickstarter, just 4 271 backers supported the game, and donated a little over a hundred thousand pounds to its development. The game is available for solo completion on PC, Mac, and Linux.</p>\n<h3>Story and setting</h3>\n<p>The player tries on the role of the captain of the ship. Captain&#39;s backstory is fully customizable. The game is a spin-off for the browser game Fallen London from the same developers: the action takes place in the same universe and at the same time. The game mixes the Victorian era and the mystical atmosphere of Lovecraft&#39;s books. The player sails between different islands of the underground sea, facing different dangers. To win, you need to achieve a certain goal: for example, to find a treasure or to gain the title of the most famous seafarer by transporting goods and opening new lands.</p>\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n<p>Death is permanent in the game - the player starts all over again after each defeat. Developers have added the ability to inherit some of the property or team of the predecessor. The game world is randomly generated, although the location of the main ports and islands remains unchanged.</p>"

He is going to use them as food for his hordes of monsters. However, the protagonists have weapons, and they will fight back.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Most of the gameplay consists of slaying monsters with a fantasy version of firearms. The game uses the top-down third-person view. The player controls his or her character with the use of a keyboard (for movement) and a mouse (for aiming). </p>\n<p>The central part of each server is Nexus, a safe zone in which the players can trade. From Nexus they teleport to various realms where they receive quests that involve killing monsters. When they kill enough monsters, they may encounter a boss, and eventually Oryx himself.</p>\n<h3>Characters</h3>\n<p>There are fifteen character classes, but the new player has to start with only Wizard class available. Other classes that include Ninja, Samurai, Paladin, and Assassin, among others, will be eventually unlocked when the player gains more experience. </p>\n<p>An unusual feature of the Realm of the Mad God is the permanent death. When the player&#39;s character is killed, he or she will not respawn. All equipment of the dead character is also lost.</p>"

A company specialised in the research, development and application of new technology and science, anything to find short-term solutions to long-term problems! As part of our brand-new Save The Day program, you\u2019ll be sent to one of many alien planets in an effort to contribute to Project Assembly, a project I am legally bound to not tell you anything about for fear of our lives. And my job.<br />\nAs an engineer and pioneer, you won\u2019t only be constructing and automating the very factory that will contribute to Project Assembly, but also explore and exploit the planet and its inhabitants as you expand. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re super inclusive when it comes to alien lifeforms! We\u2019ll even allow for pets, how cool is that!?<br />\nJust don\u2019t tell R&amp;D.<br />\nBelow you can find the three main pillars of your mission! Time to get to work, and Stay Effective!<em><br />\n</em>This motto is FICSIT Inc. property. Please do not use ironically.<br />\nCONSTRUCT<br />\nTo achieve company milestones according to satisfaction we expect you to construct your FICSIT Inc. factory in such a way that it allows for easy expansion and complexion. Not only will buildings grow more complex over time, so will the parts they produce. Project Assembly isn\u2019t your average high-school science project. We\u2019re making history here! Go big or go home!<em> Of course, this requires both high-level and low-level power management, good luck getting to nuclear! We even support stuff like multi-floor warehouses so you can stack your buildings, and a whole bunch of navigational constructs like jump pads and walkways! Walkways are the best. They\u2019re attached to the ground and everything.<br />\n</em>Employee will be expected to fund their own travel expenses<br />\nAUTOMATE<br />\nSo you know how your FICSIT Inc. factory can be turned into this incredibly intricate maze of conveyor belts in every direction, merging, splitting, crossing each other above and below? Conveyor belts carry, after all, the life-blood of our company! Well, since you\u2019ll be in a pretty big area you\u2019re going to need outposts. To make your life easier, we\u2019ve developed self-driving trucks and trains so you can set up your very own transport system between any point in your area!<br />\nEXPLORE &amp; EXPLOIT<br />\nR&amp;D hasn\u2019t figured out how to clone materials yet, weirdly enough, so you\u2019re going to have to go out and use our patented method of extraterrestrial pioneering! This means exploring to find more or new stuff to exploit, to help expand your FICSIT Inc. factory. You\u2019re on an uncharted alien planet, so try to be careful, don\u2019t go alone if you don\u2019t have to, and use protection! Who knows what kind of organisms have made this place their home? Or who knows what awesome treasures you\u2019ll find? Don\u2019t worry, this is why we assigned you your very own FICSIT Inc. handler.</p>"
