This is the same engine that was used by Valve for their hits like Half-Life and Team Fortress 2. The game started as a Half-Life mode but was renewed and re-released in 2014. The name of the game is a pun on Sergio Leone&#39;s famous western movie A Fistful of Dollars.</p>\n<h3>Weapons</h3>\n<p>The game offers a variety of XIX century weapons. In Fistful of Frags, there are five weapon classes (melee, pistols, rifles, shotguns, and special) and several weapon tiers. The lowest tier is Starter Weapons, the ones the player gets when he or she spawns. There are Blue, Red, and Gold weapons that the player can find in the chests of the respective color. Different weapons allow different actions, such as dual wielding or throwing. There&#39;s a weight limit that doesn&#39;t allow the player to carry too many weapons at once. The way the player obtains the weapons strongly depends on the mode.</p>\n<h3>Game modes</h3>\n<p>Fistful of Frags includes multiple game modes, both single and multiplayer, cooperative and competitive. In the Team Shootout mode, the players are divided into 4 or 2 teams and eliminate each other trying to get the most frags. When spawning, the player can obtain additional weapons, spending his or her &quot;stars&quot;. Break Bad mode is similar, but the goal of each team is to gather more money. The guns are also purchased with the in-game money. There are also Versus, Elimination, Shootout, and Teamplay modes.</p>"

It is loosely based on the famous horror story by H. P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos universe in general.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game is set in 1924 in Massachusetts, USA. The main character is Edward Pierce, a troubled and alcoholic private detective. He was hired to investigate the mysterious fire that destroyed the Hawkins mansion on the Darkwater Island and killed the Hawkins family. Shortly before the fire, the mother of the family drew an image of a weird monster. Pierce&#39;s investigation eventually leads him to discover the secret cult of the ancient evil god Cthulhu, who is about to awaken to unleash his rage on Earth. The protagonist faces cosmic horrors, unholy cultists, weird dimensions, and otherworldly creatures that make him question his own sanity.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Edward Pierce and navigates him across the Darkwater Island. The goal is to investigate the case by talking to other characters, searching for clues and exploring the environment. The protagonist is weak and cannot really fight a strong opponent, so the player has to find the ways to avoid trouble. Another major concern in the game is sanity. Encountering eldritch abominations and uncovering dark secrets can drive Edward insane. His mental state affects the gameplay.</p>"

The game resembles an online chat using an EOL messaging client running on an operating system that closely resembles Windows XP. There are multiple pop-culture references to the early 2000s era, such as the user profile icons, that resemble multiple old memes (like the Polish Polka), the icons on the main character&#39;s desktop that show that he is a fan of 28 Days Later, Lord of The Rings, and Red Hot Chili Peppers. </p>\n<p>As the game goes on, the players are able to change their profile icon according to the tendencies of these years. It is also possible to interact not only with Emily, but also with their classmates, and the main player&#39;s friends. The main gameplay revolves around chatting with emilyluv (she will later change her nickname to emerly). You discuss your high school love with her and your classmate Brad that harasses Emily. It turns out that your other classmate, Travis, is planning a party, which the players can choose to attend with Emily or stay at home.</p>"

Blue Team goes AWOL in order to find Master Chief&#39;s old comrade while Osiris is sent after the Team on a capture and retrieve mission.</p>\n<p>Like in previous titles, the players control a SPARTAN, biologically engineered supersoldiers that use the MJOLNIR battle armor. This armor has energy shields that deplete upon receiving any damage but regenerate after a certain amount of time. The players are capable of carrying two firearms at a time, but it is possible to pick up every weapon dropped by the enemy.</p>\n<p>Unlike the previous installments where the player could only be followed by NPCs in singleplayer but had the ability to play in a separate co-op mode, Halo 5 takes the concept further and now every of four fireteam members can be controlled by a player. The game does not feature any autonomous features like split-screen on LAN play.</p>"

The central character of the second game depends on who lost the Silver Arrow, Rook or Alette. Players will be able to see the perspective of Bolverk is some chapters.</p>\n<p>Since the game is developed by only three people, it is much easier to gather feedback by the team directly, they were able to listen to the criticisms and complaints from players about prolonged battles and lack of variety, so Banner Saga introduces new units, new talents, and new enemies. Any choices made in the first game have an impact on the events of later chapters. An entirely new race resembling centaurs, called The Horseborn.</p>"

        "description": "<p>DEFCON is a unique RTS from British Introversion Software, known for such experimental projects. The user interface is minimalistic and simple: it resembles a tactical card stylized as Cold War films such as Dr. Strangelove and WarGames.</p>\n<p>The game is divided into Defcon phases in which players need to place military forces on a real world map. There are aircraft carriers, submarines, air defense and other equipment capable of either launching a nuclear warhead or reflecting it. The winner in the match is the one who most effectively bombarded the enemy territory. Defcon is a game about pure gameplay, there is no history, as there is no story campaign.</p>\n<p>In addition to playing with AI, a player can compete with real people online in multiplayer matches. In total, such matches can accommodate up to 6 people and this significantly complicates the gameplay. Opponents should guess the location of the rival&#39;s troops and inflict the most accurate nuclear strike.</p>"

The players can acquire items that will help them in the process of escaping either by buying them from fellow prisoners or crafting them. In fact, you can always steal the items you need from someone else.</p>\n<p>It is possible to interact with other inmates who can assign tasks to the player. By completing these quests, the players can increase their respect or earn some money. Different activities such as visiting the gym or reading in the library increase the player&#39;s stats which increase the chances of a successful escape. </p>\n<p>In order for the player to not be spotted by their wardens, it is essential to avoid their attention and follow the timetable by eating food with all the other inmates, appearing at a morning gathering, and so on. The cells are often searched, so the player has to be careful and hide the tools required for the escape. If one should get detected, they&#39;re moved to the punishment cell and lose all the items and preparations they made for the escape.</p>\n<h3>Miscellanious</h3>\n<p>Five add-ons for the game were released. Each of them added new prisons, including the iconic Alcatraz prison, new escape options, crafts and much more.</p>"

In their conversation, he mentions the existence of ancient Obscura pictures and an unknown order placed on them. Unexpectedly, Lara gets knocked out. Upon coming to she finds herself next to the dead body of her mentor. Lara Croft is thought to be the murderer of the Professor. She sets out to prove otherwise.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The Angel of Darkness features both the usual action-adventure title elements as well as several RPG ones as in conversations with other characters, the players choose the lines to answer with. All the things said by Lara will influence the game&#39;s story. The game now features several stealth mechanics, which allow Lara to silently knock out enemies, find cover in the shadows, and peek out of any cover.</p>\n<p>Croft can climb walls, ladders, pipes, and ropes. The players can manage their inventory, utilize a diary, where they can find clues and tips on how to complete a level. There is no regenerative health present in the game, so the players have to pick up medkits, pills, and chocolate to restore health.</p>\n<p>The core gameplay formula of Tomb Raider games stays unchanged, as the players have to explore fairly open-ended levels while finding certain items or exits off the level.</p>"

Unlike the other installments in the series, Nations is a free-to-play game that featured in-game advertising as a form of monetization. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Like other TrackMania entries, Nations is a racing game with heavy emphasis on player-made content and simplified physics. There is only one car available in the game, which gives every player equal opportunities and accentuates the importance of skill over the right car choice or tuning.<br />\nThe single-player component consists of 100 tracks that gradually get more and more difficult. There is no collision system in the game, so other players or AI opponents do not affect your car\u2019s movement. Depending on the time it took to finish the race, the player gets bronze, silver, or gold medal. Different tracks require a certain amount of medal to unlock. <br />\nEach of the single-player tracks is available for multiplayer alongside the custom tracks that are made with in-game track-editor. </p>\n<h3>Forever version</h3>\n<p>In 2008, TrackMania Nations, alongside TrackMania United got free updates with Forever added to their name. The games became network compatible and allowed United owners to play together with Nations players on certain tracks. The Nations\u2019 physics system was updated to match that of United.</p>"

When his homeland was attacked by pirates, Otus starts an adventure to protect his home and reveal the secrets of his race. He makes new friends on the way. Each of them has special powers, useful during fights.</p>\n<p>Owlboy features classic platforming gameplay with a twist: unlike in many hardcore games of this genre, here you can fly and have almost no chance to die by falling. Otus can pick things up and use them as weapons or to solve puzzles. There are several ways to complete the same missions; your choice depends on your imagination only. Also, there are suitable tactics for different enemy types: while you can defeat some of them with direct force, the others can be destroyed in more creative ways.</p>\n<p>The game\u2019s world is organized like a huge cylinder with Otus\u2019 village on the bottom; during the game you will fly higher and higher. Missions are set in separate locations; after completing them you will return to the central hub to get new quests.</p>"

He confronts the local government and starts to sabotage their actions.</p>\n<p>Freedom Cry, like the original game, is a pirate-themed title with an accent on sea battles. The story is split into nine missions. You can explore an open-world sea map and attack ships to set slaves free. The ship development system and the amount of weaponry are reduced compared to Black Flag. The game also features land missions and side quests that allow you to upgrade your character and get additional bonuses. You even can recruit unchained slaves to your crew so they will help you in battles.</p>\n<p>Freedom Cry follows the traditions of the series and combines stealth elements, used mostly during city missions with open combat. You have several weapon types including swords, guns and throwing knives to distract enemies.</p>"

According to the idea, the player soon learns that the machine is infected with a certain demon, which captures the souls of players.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The main character gets help from the soul of a player already captured: he could not cope with the devil&#39;s trials. Pony Island is a point-and-click game that simulates the operating system using the user interface. The main task of the player is to study the internal software shell of the gaming machine, where he got stuck and tried to escape the demon. The gameplay of the game changes constantly and the player needs to participate in mini-games like endless runner and shoot-em-up.</p>\n<h3>Money for the dream</h3>\n<p>Prior to Pony Island, Daniel Mullins was already trying to release the game: right after college, in 2014, he collected the necessary money to develop his first game Catch Monsters. The successful crowdfunding experience allowed Daniel to pursue his dream and not work on boring work in the office. Pony Island was developed in just 48 hours, during the Ludum Game Jam, and later appeared on the platform for indie games Steam Greenlight. After that, the popular YouTube PewDiePie recorded and published a let&#39;s play of the game, after which the game gained enough votes, and a full release happened.</p>"

        "description": "<p>The fifth part in the Total War series, Empire is set in the 18th century. The player controls over one of the powerful empires of the era, such as Great Britain, Spain or Russia. There are more than 50 factions in the game overall, although only the major civilizations are playable, while the rest are campaign-specific minor states and colonies. The factions are not static, as colonies can claim independence, and within empires, the government can change, even in the one controlled by the player. <br />\nUnlike its predecessors, Empire: Total War puts a stronger emphasis on the empire-building in the vein of Civilization series. The game combines turn-based global strategy with an RTS-style warfare. On the strategic map, you control your empire\u2019s diplomacy, economy, religion, colonization, government, and other aspects. The battles, however, are fought as real-time wargames. The warfare is very realistic and includes a variety of units and battle movements based on military history. The units react like real people, shoot orders, and panic if they lose. Empire was also the first game in the series to introduce fully realized naval battles, which allow you to set enemy ships on fire or to board and capture them in real-time.</p>"

In addition, their decision was also influenced by the fact that by the time Quake, as a trademark, was able to ensure commercial success.</p>\n<p>Quake IV (2005)<br />\nThe game continues the story of the battle of humanity with the Stroggs.

Unfortunately, due to an accident, the professor dies and Lara has to return to Great Britain. 15 years later, Lara opens up an Egyptian tomb where an ancient Egyptian god Set was buried. She incidentally awakens an old god, so now Lara has to get him back to the tomb to prevent the Apocalypse from happening.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The main gameplay formula of Tomb Raider is largely the same. The players have to explore the levels in order to find certain items. In their search, the players have to avoid and fight enemies and use aerobatics to progress further into the level.</p>\n<p>However, compared to the last game, The Last Revelation features some major gameplay changes. Now Lara can swing on ropes to get over gaps and pits, she can use pipes to climb up the buildings, and shimmy on ledges. Instead of using the old circular inventory system, it is now linear, where all the items in your inventory are placed in a horizontal line. The players can now utilize a compass, yet it is only used for putting in cheat codes or solving a puzzle on one of the game&#39;s levels. The items in your inventory can be combined together.</p>"

There are no firearms in Penumbra, so Phillip has to fight the enemies off using mining equipment. It is better to evade any conflict rather than getting into a fight. Phillip can stick to the shadows to hide from the enemies, barricade doors or trap his enemies in the cages.</p>\n<p>During gameplay, the player has to find clues on how to complete a certain puzzle.

        "description": "<h3>Crazy action</h3>\n<p>December 3, 2016, on PS4, a single-user exclusive games called LET IT DIE was released. It was developed by the Japanese developer Grasshopper Manufacture. The release of the game on the PC is scheduled for the end of 2018. In short, what is waiting the player can be called a crazy incendiary hack and slash with the third person perspective, where the endless action and anime style graphics converged. Some aspects of the game are very reminiscent of Dark Souls.</p>\n<h3>The story</h3>\n<p>The story revolves around the corpse, which was suddenly revived. And yes - this is our main character if you can say so. Or the heroine - it depends on who you choose at the start screen. Anyway, if you die, you can just buy yourself a new shell and go on. There are a lot of locations to explore in the game. It depends on the player - exactly how to proceed - constantly using new bodies or to save money and after death to resurrect your favorite body. Note that it is very easy to die in this game. As for the goal - the player has to climb the tower, where at the very top lies the key to saving the whole world. There are more than forty floors in this tower. But this is only part of the story.</p>\n<h3>Change of plans</h3>\n<p>Initially, the game supposed to be called Lily Bergamo, but at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 conference, the name was changed to LET IT DIE. The development lasted no less than three and a half years. Also, the release date was unknown at some point, but developers managed to deliver. It came out on the model of Free to play, which attracted attention and received a lot of people who wanted to play.</p>"

Their goal is to capture a group of mercenaries who are trying to obtain a biological weapon of mass destruction. The villain, former Russian spy Merinov, is going to sell the weapon to a terrorist organization that plans to provoke a nuclear war. The protagonist will perform a number of stealth military operations in Philippines\u2019 jungle and in the highland of Tibet. There are also playable flashbacks about Anderson\u2019s experiences during the Bosnian conflict that provide more details about his past with Merinov.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Just like its name suggests, the game puts a strong emphasis on sniping. There are many mechanics that aim to make the marksmanship realistic. Each bullet\u2019s trajectory strongly depends on the wind and distance to the target. There\u2019s a HUD that displays the intensity and direction of the wind, allowing the player to aim better. A red dot indicates where the bullet will hit, though this can be disabled in a higher difficulty level. The character\u2019s physical state also influences his accuracy, and after running, he has to rest for a while before shooting. Stealth is also a vital component of the gameplay. Anderson has to sneak past enemy soldiers and cannot survive an open encounter against multiple opponents.</p>"

In every level, the rules themselves are lying as blocks you can interact with; by manipulating them, you can change how the level works and cause surprising, unexpected interactions! With some simple block-pushing you can turn yourself into a rock, turn patches of grass into dangerously hot obstacles, and even change the goal you need to reach to something entirely different.<br />\nThe game has over 100 levels that experiment with the game&#39;s mechanics in a multitude of ways, requiring the player to understand and manipulate the rules of the game and figure out devious ways to make the objects in the game world interact. The game will also feater a level editor for making your own levels and campaigns.<br />\nThe game was originally created for &amp; won the Nordic Game Jam 2017. The event had 142 entries in total. The game was made using Multimedia Fusion 2 by Clickteam.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Out There Somewhere is where Portal puzzles meet retro platforming. It begins with a scrolling shooter level at which you pilot a spaceship, but the main part of the game is completely different. The player controls the protagonist named Yuri, who crash-landed on an alien planet and is searching for the villainous Grigori who destroyed his ship. Yuri is armed with a portal gun, a device that will teleport the character to where its projectile hits a wall. Unlike in Portal, you can teleport to almost any surface as long as it\u2019s a solid object, the transportation is instant, and there are no lasting \u201cdoors\u201d. <br />\nEach level in Out There Somewhere is a small puzzle maze with an exit on the other side, and the player\u2019s goal is to figure out how to get here. Yuri can \u201cshoot himself\u201d across the lava pits toward the other shore, through narrow corridors, or away from the villains. Initially, it is all about reaction, but eventually, the game introduces more complex mechanics, such as laser beams that divert or alter Yuri\u2019s shots, and a regular gun that allows you to fight enemies. Out There Somewhere is stylized as a nostalgic 8-bit NES game with pixel-art graphic and is accompanied by a chiptune soundtrack.</p>"

Twenty years after the ending of Diablo II, a star has fallen on the city of New Tristram, spawning hordes of undead monsters that the player must defeat. As usual in Diablo series, the game has a trademark dark fantasy atmosphere and is mostly set in gloomy dungeons.<br />\nThe basic gameplay features are the same as in previous Diablo games, but there are many subtle changes. The player can choose one of six character classes (a seventh is available with an expansion). Each class has its unique abilities and class-specific quests. Unlike its predecessors, which used isometric 2D graphics, Diablo III uses 3D, however, it preserves the familiar top-down view. The dungeons are randomly generated and have destructible environments, thanks to the new graphics engine. There\u2019s a new mechanic Skill Runes that is used to improve the character\u2019s skills.<br />\nOnline multiplayer is available through Battle.net. There are both a co-op mode and a PvP mode called Brawling. The players can create hardcore characters who face permadeath if killed. Even in the single-player mode, Diablo II requires a stable internet connection, because of DRM restrictions.</p>"

In the Storyline mode, you begin the game as Marcus Campbell. However, though you only control one character at a time, AI-controlled allies will aid you on your missions, and if the main character is killed, you will switch to another hero from your community. Each character has a set of skills that can be improved by repetitive actions, such as fighting.<br />\nThe main goal is to help your people survive by building and protecting a safe haven. You can improve your base with multiple buildings, such as kitchens and medical bays. The game is strongly focused on resource management. There are no shops in the post-apocalyptic world, and most resources have to be scavenged. However, there are NPCs and other survivor communities you can interact with. You can trade with them and even recruit them to join your community as new members. There&#39;s also a variety of zombies that will attack your characters. The game offers you more than 100 weapons, both melee and ranged. All weapons have limited durability and will break down eventually.</p>"

From the point of view of gameplay, the game is not much different from other ones of the series of that time: it is a side-scrolling 2D platformer where the main goal of the player is to go as fast as possible. The game is often called the best in the series. In the development, it ought to be an improved version of the game Sonic The Hedgehog 2, but because of the low sales of the last, it was decided not to advertise connection between the two. Later the game was released on Sony PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube as part of the Sonic Gems Collection. The remastered version that uses a new engine was released for various platforms and mobile devices in 2011.</p>\n<h3>The plot</h3>\n<p>The plot of the game tells how Sonic goes to Never Lake, where the extraterrestrial body Little Planet appears at the end of the last month of each year. However, this time the main villain of the Sonic universe Dr. Robotnik tied the planet to the top of the mountain and began to transform its surface with the help of its robots into a huge factory. Sonic goes to the rescue to encounter not only Dr. Robotnik but also other characters in the series, such as Metal Sonic.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The gameplay of the game has not changed: Sonic must complete levels and defeat bosses at the end of each world. After collecting 50 rings, a special level becomes available, on which the player must destroy six UFOs. The version of the game for Steam includes the ability to play in 16: 9, leaderboards and a bunch achievements.</p>"

In most game modes, you take \u043brole of a Lord and have to develop your castle increasing its population, creating a stable economy and strong military while maintaining your popularity among the people. The game attends both the war and economics aspect. There are many types of resources in the game that can be divided into two groups: food and materials. The townspeople constantly consume food, so the player has to develop a stable production of meat, bread, apples, and cheese. Each of these types of food requires different structures and has different stages of production. <br />\nUnlike most other RTS, each military unit requires a different set of recourse to be created. E.g., crossbowman needs a crossbow and leather armor; swordsman needs a sword and metal armor. <br />\nThe game has two campaigns: military and economic. In the latter, you don\u2019t have to with other Lords, but only wild animals. Besides that, there is a free mode where you can develop your castle without any objectives or time restrictions and siege mode, separate scenarios that do not involve castle building but instead lets player attack or defend several historical castles.</p>"

Sven Co-op supports Half-Life&#39;s singleplayer but changes it up a bit to improve upon the cooperative aspect of the game.</p>\n<p>The levels of Sven Co-op are divided into missions and are usually separated from each other. Many missions take place on several maps with some of them being fused into one. The objective of most levels is to find an exit or complete a specific task - it is not necessary to kill any enemies whatsoever. The maps are used using a variety of settings, starting with Black Mesa and ending with a modern urban war one.</p>\n<h3>Changes in comparison with the original game</h3>\n<p>There are only 12 changes in the original Half-Life gameplay, yet they do not drastically affect the gameplay. Most of the changes were made to the NPCs and the NPC following system. Now you can take any friendly NPC with you, some of the NPCs will even heal you. Several small changes also affect the enemy behavior, for example, the players can no longer free themselves from the barnacles. A teammate is needed to get you out.</p>"

An enemy power has recently overthrown the local pro-American government. The player assumes control over the US special forces agents and Truenian rebels who fight against the new regime. In Sniper: Ghost Warrior, the player assumes the roles of several main characters, among them a US soldier Tyler Wells who performs sniping and stealth operations, and a local rebel El Tejon who is most useful in open combat.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>There are several types of missions in the game. Some of them emphasize stealth action and marksmanship, while others involve direct firefight. Besides a variety of sniper rifles, the characters can use other silent weapons, such as knives and silenced handguns.</p>\n<p>The game has a quasi-realistic model of bullet ballistics. The player has to take into account the distance to the target and the bullet&#39;s flight time. The wind and the shooter&#39;s physical condition also influence the accuracy. In lower difficulty levels, the player can use the system that indicates the designated target and the place of the actual hit.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Gameplay<br />\nFriday the 13th: The Game is a third-person horror, survival game where players take on the role of a teen counselor, or for the first time ever, Jason Voorhees. You and six other unlucky souls will do everything possible to escape and survive while the most well-known killer in the world tracks you down and brutally slaughters you.  Friday the 13th: The Game will strive to give every single player the tools to survive, escape or even try to take down the man who cannot be killed. Each and every gameplay session will give you an entirely new chance to prove if you have what it takes not only to survive, but to best the most prolific killer in cinema history, a slasher with more kills than any of his rivals!<br />\nMeanwhile, Jason will be given an array of abilities to track, hunt and kill his prey. Stalk from the shadows, scare your targets and kill them when the time is right in as brutal a fashion as you can imagine. Take control of the legendary killer that is Jason Voorhees and terrify those unfortunate enough to cross your path!<br />\nPlay as Jason Voorhees!<br />\nFor the first time ever, you will have the opportunity to play as Jason Voorhees, the most famous killer in horror. Stalk your prey, ambush them whenever you see fit and strike fear in the hearts of so many hapless victims as you become the legend himself! Friday the 13th: The Game will include a variety of kills, new and familiar, that will help you set the tone for the Jason Voorhees that you want to be. You\u2019ll even get to unlock various Jason incarnations from the movies!<br />\nJason will be equipped with a terrifying array of abilities, giving you the control of a hunter at the height of his game. These are his woods, and he knows them all too well. Jason will not only feed off the fear of his victims, but will become stronger as the night progresses. The darker the night, the more terrifying Jason becomes!<br />\nFans of the movies will be able to play as various versions of Jason, including:<br />\nFriday the 13th, Part II<br />\nFriday the 13th, Part III<br />\nFriday the 13th, Part VI: Jason Lives<br />\nFriday the 13th, Part VII: New Blood<br />\nFriday the 13th, Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan<br />\nJason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday<br />\nHow Will You Survive?<br />\nThe entire focus of Friday the 13th: The Game is multiplayer. Survival is entirely up to you, the player, as you either stealthily hide from Jason or work together as a team to escape or bring the fight to Jason. Playing as a counselor is all about risk and reward, giving players multiple means of triumph over Jason! Want to hide in the woods as you wait for the police? Perhaps you want to band together and try to take on Jason as a group? Maybe you and a friend decide to fix the boat on the lake and escape while leaving everyone else to their fate? There are endless opportunities to survive the night, but every choice has a consequence.<br />\nFriday the 13th: The Game will continually set the pace of change, giving you unfamiliar surroundings while Jason Voorhees looks for his latest victim. No single strategy will ever be reliable, forcing players to adapt and change each time they begin their long night in Camp Blood! Be wary, you never know when or where Jason is going to strike!<br />\nPlay as the Counselors!<br />\nWe all remember the various tropes from Friday the 13th, and the game will be no exception! Each counselor type will have strengths and weaknesses, affording players the chance to excel in certain situations. Find the counselor that best suits your play style, or come up with various strategies to win against Jason! Players will have the chance to continually update and improve their characters through unlocks, customization and improvement! The more you play, the more you adapt and become a better all-around counselor!<br />\nCamp Crystal Lake in All Its Glory!<br />\nMirroring Camp Crystal Lake from the Friday the 13th series, players will try to survive not only in the iconic Camp Crystal Lake, but surrounding area. Iconic locations from the movies, like Higgins Haven will also serve as stalking grounds for Jason and his prey.<br />\nPlayers will be given a large, open area in which to explore as they attempt to hide from certain death! Each gameplay session will fundamentally change the scenario, never affording players the opportunity to learn patterns or figure out where helpful items may be lying. With each movie giving a different feeling to the campgrounds, Friday the 13th: The Game gives you new and challenging situations every time you enter the woods!<br />\nYour Crystal Lake Database<br />\nFriday the 13th: The Game will feature a progressive unlock system unified to your account. The longer you play, the more you&#39;ll unlock from counselor customization to new Jason Voorhees costumes seen in the movies! Besides giving you personalized camp counselors, you&#39;ll be able to unlock secrets within Camp Crystal Lake, exploring the mystery surrounding Jason Voorhees and the grounds he patrols!<br />\nBe Kind. Rewind.<br />\nEvery aspect of Friday the 13th: The Game<br />\nis drawn straight from movies you know and love. We\u2019ve carefully crafted this world to remind you of<br />\neverything you remember about Friday the 13th, right down to the visual fidelity of the 80\u2019s. This is exactly how you remember it.</p>"

The series and the game, in particular, is considered one of the most canon hack-and-slash adventures, setting the mark for many other titles.<br />\nThe fourth game utilizes the universal gameplay principles for such games: the whole gaming process is divided into levels and getting through one grant the player with the grade from &quot;D&quot; to &quot;SSS.&quot; The grade ultimately depends on time spent within the mission, avoiding damage and style. The style is a game forming principle of DmC \u2014 unbreakable combos, interleaving punches, kicks and shooting: all of the above defines the style. There are two playable characters in DmC \u2014 Dante and Nero.

        "description": "<p>Nuclear Throne is a top-down roguelike shooter, set in a post-apocalyptic universe.</p>\n<h3>Plot and features</h3>\n<p>The game has a sole objective: to reach the famed Nuclear Throne. The player controls one of the many mutated characters. Each playable character is unlockable through levels, and has unique abilities, allowing for different approaches in every playthrough. Each level follows the same pattern: kill enemies, collect upgrades, kill a boss. However, there are many possibilities for a skilled player, as there are achievements to complete, and daily and weekly missions, which can have different objectives.</p>\n<p>###Gameplay<br />\nDying resets the game\u2019s progress, while success opens up new mutations, weapons, and enemy types. There are five ammunition types, and many weapons share the ammo, so player often has to choose wisely. Mutations can be achieved through leveling up, with some available only to certain mutants, while others are free to choose from. Said mutations can emphasize on character\u2019s unique skill, his weapon proficiency, or upgrade his stats.</p>\n<h3>Graphics and soundtrack</h3>\n<p>The game\u2019s pixel art design is made very distinct and unique, as the setting of a post-nuclear western can lead to great possibilities for artists. Each texture, albeit simple, is recognizable and well-made, and the stylistics further emphasize the work of game\u2019s designers. The soundtrack is a mix-match of 8-bit samples and Wild West themes, resulting in a very immersive and entertaining playthrough.</p>"

The game functions on the Quake III: Arena engine.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The whole series and the Return, in particular, depict the events of the World War II. The game tells a story of the year 1943 and follows the story arc of the agent Blazkowicz and Agent One who infiltrated the Nazi base and found themselves captured and sent to the Castle Wolfenstein. The narrative centers around their escape past the overpowered enemies called &quot;\u00fcbersoldaten&quot; and figuring out the solution to the multiple mazes.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is one of the progenitors of the corridor shooters \u2014 the notion has not been spoiled yet, and the strictly linear games were the classics of the genre. Although the title exploits the basic mechanics of shooting enemies and moving around the territory, the player is suggested with some firearms and tools. <br />\nThere is a multiplayer which is based on a number of the quests and two teams set to accomplish them. The team who achieves the primary goal first wins. There are three modes: an objective, stopwatch, and checkpoint. Objective aims at the fulfilling the goal, and stopwatch controls the progress achieved within the period, and checkpoint fixes the progress at its milestones.</p>"

Upon the Prince&#39;s arrival, the kingdom is found to be under a siege. Trying to repel the invaders, Malik uses an ancient mystic medallion that frees the ancient army of Solomon. Upon breaking free, the army turns the people of the kingdom into sand statues. Only the Prince of Persia can stop the army from destroying the kingdom.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game uses the usual Action-adventure formula where the player-controlled character traverses the level while avoiding traps, solves puzzles, and fights enemies using aerobatics and special powers. The game features a complex fighting system. </p>\n<p>As the game progresses, the Prince learns more and more skills. The player is able to control all four nature elements: fire, earth, water, and air. Using such power, it is easy to manipulate the game&#39;s environment. It is essential to combine magic skills with the fighting system in order to be most efficient in the game.</p>\n<p>As in previous games of the series, it is possible to rewind time. If the player makes a mistake and the Prince dies, the player can travel several seconds back into the gameplay. If such a thing is impossible, the player has to restart from the latest checkpoint.</p>"

Clementine is an original character from the previous episodes.<br />\nShe is still alive and trying to survive. She meets Javier Garcia. Javier\u2019s family was taken from him, so he has to find them. Together they find out about the existence of the New Frontier. It is a group of survivors, whose credibility is ambiguous. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Like two past seasons, the third one is a point-and-click adventure. However, in turn, there are two available characters.<br />\nYou can play as a Javier, who was introduced only in this episode. The player can choose Clementine, but only in flashbacks. You control and direct your character around the environment, explore different scenery elements and pick up and keep objects. These objects can be used to advance the story later.<br />\nMoreover, you can begin dialogues with non-player characters. Their answers can give a broad range of choices; it even includes staying silent. The time for making a selection is limited. However, even if the player does not make it, the conversation is not stopping. In this case, it is regarded as you stayed silent. These choices have an impact on later events. There are more action-oriented scenes, where you have to make quick decisions. If you fail it, you would have to restart from the very beginning of the scene.</p>"

It is the ninth title in the main Final Fantasy series and the last to debut on the original PlayStation. The game plot centers on the consequences of a war between nations in a medieval fantasy world called Gaia. Players follow bandit Zidane Tribal, who kidnaps Alexandrian princess Garnet Til Alexandros XVII as part of a gambit by the neighboring nation of Lindblum. He joins Garnet and a growing cast of characters on a quest to take down her mother, Queen Brahne of Alexandria, who started the war. The plot shifts when the player learns that Brahne is a pawn of a more menacing threat, Kuja, who shares a mysterious history with Zidane spanning two worlds.<br />\nThe game was developed alongside Final Fantasy VIII. Envisioned by developers as a retrospective for the series, it departed from the futuristic settings of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII by returning to the medieval style of the first six installments. Consequently, it was influenced heavily by the original Final Fantasy game, and features allusions to the rest of the titles. Despite this approach, the game did introduce new features to the series, such as &quot;Active Time Event&quot; cutscenes, &quot;Mognet&quot;, and unique equipment and skill systems.<br />\nFinal Fantasy IX was released to critical acclaim. It is often cited by critics and fans as one of the best Final Fantasy titles, and holds the highest Metacritic score of the series. Final Fantasy IX was commercially successful, selling more than 5 million copies worldwide by March 2003 and 5.5 million copies by February 2016. It was re-released in 2010 as a PSOne Classic on the PlayStation Store; this version was compatible with PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation Vita support arrived in 2012. In 2016, ports featuring minor gameplay and graphical enhancements were released for iOS, Android and Microsoft Windows followed by a port for PlayStation 4 in 2017.</p>"

        "description": "<p>UNO is a video game adaptation of a famous card game developed in the 20th century. The aim is to be the first one to win 500 points. There is also a variation of the game called Uno Rush, announced two years later than the original.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The rules and card design do not differ from the original. Four players are sitting across the table.<br />\nEvery player can check out his points in the composite chart. The round proceeds clockwise, it is supported by the revolving arrows and sound effects. The deck consists of 108 cards, 25 of each color. When it\u2019s a player\u2019s turn to go, he has to match the top card in the discard pile based on color, number or symbol of the card. They are dealt automatically to each player. It lets one focus on the game itself rather than on the mechanics.   </p>\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n<p>The main visual appearance is a red screen and slow music so that the game screen can set up the background. There is not much action in the setting as the main processes appear between the players. Just like the original, one can\u2019t see the opponents\u2019 decks, so their goal is to become the first one to gain points. The player can also change the appearance in different game versions. For example, in Partner Uno the player with partners sit across from each other; the Xbox Live Version supports the webcams, which makes the action more intense. The video game has several teams over the internet, so it is possible to participate in live tournaments with players from around the world.</p>"

The game offers the players many was of succeeding in their objective. For example, if a player encounters a gate, they can either pick its lock using the picklock skill, climb over, force the gate or blow it up.</p>\n<p>Initially, the player controls a squad of four which can be expanded up to seven characters.

Excellent reviews and 92/100 score on Metacritic is a serious indicator. In the Steam community, there are still enthusiastic nostalgic reviews of almost everything that concerns Tom Clancy&#39;s Splinter Cell Chaos Theory. And there is an explanation for this. The game was released in 2005 and became the third in the Splinter Cell series. Canadian studio Ubisoft Montreal was engaged in the development, who is also responsible for Assassin&#39;s Creed and Far Cry. Critics and player noted the Xbox and PC versions of the game as the best. </p>\n<h3>The story</h3>\n<p>In Tom Clancy&#39;s Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, the player will feel like a professional spy, NSA agent Sam Fisher from a special unit called \u201cThe Third Echelon.\u201d The plot takes its origin from the first game in the series. However, the narrative is constructed in such a way that the player does not necessarily have to go through it in order to enjoy the story. The events of the game occur in different parts of the Earth that are based on places from the real world. At the heart of the game is the conflict unfolding between China, North Korea, South Korea, and Japan.</p>\n<p>In addition to a single user campaign, there is the possibility of playing on the net. However, the official online services for this game were disabled as early as August 2016. Despite this, players still have the opportunity to play on the local network or, with due skill - through third-party services.</p>"

It is the direct continuation of Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain and is the second title in the series.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game takes place 1500 years after the events of Blood Omen. It tells the story of Raziel, a lieutenant vampire in the Kain&#39;s army. Kain almost kills Raziel and throws him down the Lake of the Dead. However, an elder god saves Raziel from death and turns him into a Soul Stealer to help him take revenge on Kain. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is completely different from its predecessor. The game is played from the third person with the player being able to move it by themselves.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is based on the ability to travel between the material and spirit worlds. This allows the player to continue on the game&#39;s plot. The item interaction in the spirit world is limited, yet it also benefits Raziel as he can pass the gates that he is unable to go through in the material world. Many of the game&#39;s puzzles are based on the differences between these two worlds. The puzzle environment of the material world can be completely different in the spirit one.</p>\n<p>The game&#39;s combat system is based on the hack and slash principle and consists out of multiple attacks and finishing moves. The enemies of Raziel are divided into three groups: humans, spirit beings, and vampires. The main feature of the combat system is the usage of the in-world items as your own weapons.</p>"

There are 10 missions for each faction. The goals are different for each mission. For example, the player may have to destroy the opposing force&#39;s base or survive an assault from the enemy. Sometimes the number of units the player can have is limited. The players collect gold to purchase new units and mana to cast magic spells. After the player purchases and builds a unit, they automatically march towards the enemies base and attack every enemy they encounter. The spells can be cast in order to strengthen your own units or attack the enemies. </p>\n<p>The game also features a competitive split-screen multiplayer and other modes that can be unlocked by playing the game.</p>"

This installment serves as a reboot of the Soulcalibur series.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The plot retells the events that happened before and during the original Soulcalibur and alters them, thus creating a new timeline for the franchise. The events of the game are set between 1583 and 1590. As with the original, the story is based around the conflict between two magical swords, the evil Soul Edge that devours souls and Soul Calibur, the spiritual sword, and their respective wielders. The Soul Edge belonged to a dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon until a brave knight named Siegfried challenged him.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is meant to attract new players to the series, and some of the changes were made for that goal. For example, the game introduces Reversal Edge mechanic, in which two opponents enter a slow-mo scene and exchange blows in a rock-paper-scissors manner by pushing a single button. This option allows even the novice players to counter most types of attacks. There&#39;s also a new Lethal Hit mechanic which allows the players to knock the opponent down by performing moves in the right time.</p>\n<h3>Characters</h3>\n<p>The game includes most of the popular characters of the series, such as Mitsurugi, Siegfried, Sophitia, and Cervantes de Leon. Some of the characters are redesigned. Geralt, the famous protagonist of The Witcher series, appears as a playable guest character.</p>"

Every fifth hit allows you to use a special trick. Each character in the reserve has a pair of very peculiar ways to drive the ball right into the opponent&#39;s face. For example, such techniques as acceleration or deceleration of the ball. As a result of using these techniques, the game can obviously become much shorter or stretch in time.</p>\n<p>There are three game modes.

Knowing the location of the proposed enemy, you can choose for the fight those whom you know.</p>\n<p>The second option &quot;extra&quot; allows you to compete with the computer, improve your playing skills and the speed of reaction to the ball flying towards the face. Also this option allows you to pump your team, opening new skill levels and increasing the palette of skins.</p>\n<p>The third option makes it possible to form teams for the game &quot;two vs two&quot;, which gives dynamics to a murderous match.</p>"

You\u2019ll have to fight or blend in with the drug-addled inhabitants, most of whom don\u2019t take kindly to people who won\u2019t abide by their not-so-normal rules.<br />\nDiscover the retrofuturistic city\u2019s dark history as you play through the intertwined narratives of three quietly rebellious citizens of Wellington Wells, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, as they face their pasts, prepare for the future, and engage in activities that aren\u2019t exactly status quo in the artificially enthused society.<br />\nSave 15% when you pre-purchase We Happy Few, and get instant access to the game&#39;s alpha.

Come unveil its dark history, and discover how and why its residents came to be so beguilingly happy.<br />\nThree Interwoven Narratives<br />\nPlay as three flawed characters who explore their own connections to the events surrounding the rebuilding of Wellington Wells. They each have a unique storyline in which they interpret and react to the events around them in different ways. As you hide, conform, or fight back as each of them, you will encounter dark humour, a spot of hope, and even some redemption along the way.<br />\nA Dystopia of Your Very Own<br />\nIn We Happy Few, no two playthroughs are alike. While the citizens of Wellington Wells will always want to ensure that you\u2019ve taken your Joy, the procedurally generated world will ensure that your experience with We Happy Few is different and unique.

It was initially developed as an exclusive for OUYA microconsole and was later ported on other systems as TowerFall Ascension. The gameplay represents an arcade-style fighting arena where four people combat each other to score points in a series of rounds. There are for several characters to choose from in the game. Every one of them has two main ways of killing opponents: bow and stomping. Every player starts with only 3 arrows which, after being shot, can be picked from the spot where they fell. The player can also jump on each other in retro-platformer style. The arenas exit is connected with exits on the opposite side of the map, so if the player falls down the pit, he immediately appears from the top of the arena. There also several powerups that can be found in treasure chest scattered across the map.  <br />\nThe Ascension version of the game also features single-player mode in which player has to kill waves of enemies on the arena. It has no story whatsoever and is more like a series of challenges with different monsters, powerups and unique peculiarities on locations.</p>"

The main heroine abandons her genie powers and stars adjusting to the life of a regular human being. One day she comes across the previous game\u2019s antagonist, a pirate named Risky Boots that tells her about evil and fearsome tyrant Pirate Master sealed long ago by genies wants to revive himself using Dark Magic. Now Shantae must form an unexpected alliance with her past rival to stop Pirate Master. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Regarding gameplay, Shantae and the Pirate\u2019s Curse shares many similarities with previous games in the series. It is a 2D side-scroller that is not divided into several levels but rather takes place in one interconnected world. The game mostly consists of fighting enemies, solving puzzles, platforming sections, interacting with different NPC that can give you quests or sell useful items. Since Shantae abandoned her genie powers, in this game you do not use magic abilities, instead of throughout the game you collect different pirate items such as a pistol, a pirate hat, pirate boots, scimitar, and cannon. Each of them gives player new abilities that help in combat, puzzle solving or open previously closed areas of the game world.</p>"

The game was inspired by war movies like Bridge on the River Kwai and Saving Private Ryan, and some missions are set at the background of the real events shown in this films, such as the Battle of Normandy. There are ten main missions, not counting tutorial, and ten bonus missions are unlocked after you complete the storyline. Most missions require sneaking, camouflaging, and stealth action. The maps are not covered by the fog of war, so you can study them beforehand to thoroughly plan the squad\u2019s movements.<br />\nFor each mission, you&#39;re given a predetermined set of characters. Each member of the squad is named after his or her specialization, such as Sniper, Diver, or Seductress, and has a set of unique abilities and a colorful personality. Spy, for example, can disguise himself as an enemy officer to send the guards away, while Sapper can set and disable landmines. Most characters are from the original Commandos, but there are also new members, such as a sneaky Thief and Whiskey, the squad\u2019s bull terrier. The variety of characters\u2019 skills was also increased to make them more versatile.</p>"

The Beginning Hour follows a standalone story indirectly connected to the main game.</p>\n<p>You take on the role of an unnamed man that wakes up in an abandoned house. During the exploration you find a tape and see a film crew that was attacked here by someone. You need to follow their way around the house to reveal the truth about its owners. The plot has four endings depending on your actions during the second part of the game.</p>\n<p>Both the main game and its demo version are focused on atmosphere rather than on fights. You have almost no weapons and have to act stealthily. As the Beginning Hour is strictly time-limited it doesn\u2019t feature many monsters or action scenes; the gameplay is based on exploration. The most frightening aspect of the game is its suspenseful atmosphere and the lack of knowledge about the house and its hosts.</p>"

This choice affects the additional cards that will be dropped as a reward after leveling up.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the match, each player starts out with one magic point and three cards. On each turn, one magic point is granted to the players. The first player to get his enemies health to less than 1 wins.</p>"

Their famous protagonists fight each other on an arena. In accordance with its name, the game is the \u201cultimate\u201d installment of the series, in that it offers the players all the characters ever featured in Super Smash Bros. The game also introduces five new characters, most famously, Castlevania&#39;s Simon Belmont.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Unlike most fighting games, Super Smash Bros. series is built around knocking opponents out of the arena rather than lowering their health bars. However, the damage meter increases the character&#39;s chances to be knocked out. Each fighter has a limited number of lives and loses one when he or she is knocked out. The player is eliminated when he or she loses all lives.</p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate includes several competitive multiplayer modes. Besides the traditional versus mode, there are several new modes not featured in the previous games. These include Tournament (the playoff mode for 32 players), Smash Squad (team multiplayer), Smashdown (a mode in which the defeated characters are eliminated).</p>"

Each player starts the game with thirty cards.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the turn, the player draws a card from their cards and receives three points of Faeria (mana). If by the player manages to take a well of mana, the player receives one mana point additionally for each well. The game also uses the Power Wheel, different cards have different potentials and affect the game in many ways. Laying out cards on the field also matters - laying out cards is regulated by the rules and gives as a result combinations of different strength and quality. Playing cards spends mana reserves, each card requires a certain amount of mana in reserve to play. And the enemy is harmed through a decrease in the health - the cards affect this figure. Victories give in-game currency to the player, which they can pay for new cards with and make the stock of cards unique.</p>"

Dodging bullets and moving around hordes of enemies can be tricky, but the game emphasizes that the main way to achieve is not just spamming two skills, but employing techniques and developing character\u2019s abilities in the way that would be comfortable to the player. The different loot system helps the character in his journey, as various weapons have their unique abilities, and often improves character\u2019s skills.</p>\n<p>The game\u2019s art style is highly reminiscent of Dracula movies and other vampire-based stories. The grim locations and fearsome enemies leave a mark on any player, and the soundtrack of the game also adds to the overall mood of evil lingering in the dark.</p>"

Murdered! And obviously Microsol, the Terraforming company wants you dead too!\nIt's that huge new rock formation you and Buce uncovered - it's Gravitium, and it's priceless. Tyrian is the only planet where it exists in commercial quantities, and Microsol are determined to control it. You can expect them to throw all their resources against you - and they won't pull any punches.\nClassic, oldschool and just awesome vertical schooter gameplay at its best.\nGameplay mechanics that are easy to learn but hard to master. \nShip Editor - create your own ship and rule the skies."

In 2013, the game got a reboot on the Xbox One, and in 2017 the game moved to the PC.</p>\n<p>Killer Instinct of 2017 is all the same one on one melee fights. The developers got inspiration from other legendary games in the genre: attack set was borrowed from Street Fighter series and finishing moves from Mortal Kombat. In the reboot, the Combo Breaker mechanic has been changed a little - now it is necessary to coincide in strength and timing with a counter blow to make a successful break. The plot of the game almost wholly repeats the plot of the first part: each fighter passes the way in a tournament organized by a mega-corporation and fights with the final Fulgore boss. The details of the story are different for each character.</p>\n<p>You can fight for 20 stages with a dynamically changing environment and destructibility. Besides, the game has all the fighters from the previous parts. The plot campaign with cinematic cut scenes will have to be done alone. With other players, you can compete in online multiplayer, with the online ranking system. To play on a PC, the developers advise using a controller.</p>"

The game is intentionally made with extremely minimalistic graphics and simplest textures, and is set to dubstep music. Visually, Dead Bits somewhat reminds Minecraft, but gameplay-wise, it\u2019s a combination of the first-person shooter with platforming elements. <br />\nThe protagonist named Quilly was kidnapped by the aliens led by Quanton. Quilly has to complete a series of tests for Quanton before he is released. The \u201ctests\u201d actually consist of short levels in which you fight zombies and giant humanoid robots made of boxes. The protagonist starts each level armed with either a gun, an iron stick, or even nothing at all at some levels where you have to find the weapons yourself. Most levels are set on the platforms floating in the middle of nowhere, though there\u2019s also a claustrophobic corridor level with limited visibility. Outside of the cutscenes, there\u2019s no character model. Quilly has no visible legs and casts no shadow, which makes navigating the platforms way more difficult than one might expect. Each Quilly\u2019s death is followed by a cutscene that cannot be skipped.</p>"

It is the first installment of the Splinter Cell franchise.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>In 2003, the United States government formed a new covert agency to gather intelligence. It is a top-secret organization named Third Echelon. The agency has access to cutting-edge surveillance and military technologies. Third Echelon&#39;s agents are free to violate any law as long as it is required to complete the mission successfully.</p>\n<p>In 2004, contact is lost with a CIA agent. Homeland security sends a second agent to check on the CIA&#39;s asset, yet contact is lost again. Third Echelon sends Sam Fischer to investigate the situation.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game&#39;s main focus is to hide from the enemy instead of going loud and gun-blazing. The players have to leave no trace of themselves. It is essential to stick to the shadows, use the environment for cover and carefully pick your equipment to avoid detection.</p>\n<p>Shadows are the best friend of the player. A special indicator is present on an in-game HUD that shows if the players are visible to their enemies. The game does not welcome the usage of weapons as the sound of gunfire is very loud and can be heard from the distance. The players have to rely on headshots, as they don&#39;t have much ammo on them. Sam has multiple advanced gadgets to aid him in his mission as well as a lot of hand-to-hand combat experience.</p>"

Ultima IV further improves the franchise with dialog improvements, new means of travel and exploration, and world interactivity.</p>\n<p>In 1996 Computer Gaming World named Ultima IV as #2 on its Best Games of All Time list on the PC.

However, its plot is very unusual, although it does not contradict such a definition of the genre.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Your character is a person who is deadly tired of a very common problem: the neighbors who threw a noisy party, not taking into account that they do not live alone in the world.</p>\n<p>In ordinary life, you usually silently endure or call the police. But in this game you should just kill everyone who has the imprudence to make noise. You can do it with a knife, and you can use other, very simple, improvised means. At first, you only have a knife, but over time, the tools appear more interesting.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game has ten unique levels. Some details of each level are generated randomly, so each game is somewhat different from the other.</p>\n<p>After loading the level of the hero finds himself standing in front of a building or a complex of buildings, where there is a party with the participation of about fifty people.</p>\n<p>It is assumed that by this time your character is already quite angry. And now he faces only one simple task - to destroy all.</p>\n<p>The character has the skills to work with a knife, can set a variety of different traps, use various items.</p>\n<p>There are also obstacles in the game. For example, party members may call the police, there are guards in the building, and if you kill a police officer, FBI agents will arrive. There are also others who may suddenly appear.</p>\n<h3>Bonuses</h3>\n<p>Your character is not always the same person. There are several characters in the game that you can become as you play. These characters are more capable of killing, among them there are ninja and even a policeman.</p>\n<p>You may have allies, someone you can call for help.</p>\n<p>There is also a spin-off simulation game titled Party Hard Tycoon.</p>"

        "description": "<p>World of Tanks Blitz is a cross-platform action game, aiming at fierce tank combat. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay&lt;h3/&gt;</h3>\n<p>The game allows 7v7 battles. The teams are forming randomly, so there can be tanks from different classes (light, medium, heavy and destroyers) and countries (German, UK, USA, and others).<br />\nThe player has to either destroy enemies\u2019 units or capture the neutral base. The base is regarded as taken if your tank stays in a marked zone for a while without getting damaged. The capture proceeds faster as you place more tanks there. Also, there is a superiority mode, which requires the players to win, if they eliminate all foes\u2019 vehicles and gain 1000 win points. Capturing points can earn these points and destroying enemy equipment. There is a possibility to form platoons for two people and to join clans. Many mechanics are taken from the PC-version, for instance, the physics of damage. While moving along the hilly terrain, you can also notice such mechanisms: you can do drift, driving a portable tank on a high-speed. Each map consists of two starting points of the teams. The battlefield itself has many objects and shelters: buildings, bridges, walls, trees.</p>\n<h3>Premium features</h3>\n<p>There are two currency systems in the game: credits and gold. You can earn credits from the battles. Both group and individual victories are rewarded. Gold can be purchased for real money, and also received in the course of various actions. Some features of the game become available only if paid in gold.</p>"

Developers abandoned the mechanics with a number of lives players have for every walkthrough and until at least one of the party is alive, he can revive the rest. The action takes place in the 17th century: the British Empire colonized Mars. The decent story plays a secondary role, the main focus on gameplay.</p>\n<p>The game includes wild intensity, handcrafted visuals of the classic arcade and an insanely flickering screen like in Japanese bullet hell games. Developers used real Roanoke Colony and its inhabitants as a reference and animated films of Hayao Miyazaki as an inspiration.</p>\n<p>There are 4 types of ships in total, each with two attacks: the primary one and the secondary one. There are 20 additional steampunk levels available for players to complete, which even those who have never played bullet-hell will like. The soundtrack and careful work on visual styles put gamers into a trance and creates an illusion of full immersion in the world of the game.</p>"

The sleepwalker follows a distinct path. The players have to change this path and guide him in the right direction. The players have to be careful with their decisions as the sleepwalker can just walk off the level. Several entities can also prevent the sleepwalker from arriving at his destination. Most of these entities just block the path and have to be moved out of the way by the player.</p>\n<p>The game features a surreal art style which is somewhat inspired by Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali. There&#39;s also a small mix of the sixties inspired artwork which can be seen in the sleepwalker&#39;s outfit or simply the typography of the game.</p>"

There are always some clues or rules on how to solve puzzles in the game. During a puzzle, the player can ask for no more than three hints that help to solve puzzles but it costs a chewing gum. About gum \u2013 it seems that there is a shortage of gum in the city the game is set and Nelson Tethers, the same protagonist from the previous game, has to collect pieces of chewing gum throughout the game. During each puzzle, Nelson has not only to solve it but also to send his answer to HQ, who either approves it or not.

The game is set first in the fantasy world of Endoria, same as the predecessor, and then swiftly transfers to the world of Teana, where the main events occur.<br />\nThe protagonist has a task of finding the legendary knight of her kingdom, the previous game\u2019s main character, to save her besieged world. Role-playing elements of the game include three different classes for your hero, a different companion, which provides help in battle, and inventory system which affects your gameplay by adding various excellent or dangerous situations.<br />\nThe art style of the game is reminiscent of fantasy-themed cartoons, but it also makes every character in the game unique and distinct, with almost no animation repetitive or texture getting overused. The soundtrack adds to the immersion in the fantasy battles, providing a mood for every location and making a significant impact on the playthrough.</p>"

The city of Albatropolis was subdued by a ruthless army of penguins led by dictator Putzki. You assume the role of Hardboiled Chicken, a rebel commando rooster who is tasked with killing the tyrant. He will, however, eventually discover there\u2019s much more behind the penguins\u2019 plot. <br />\nThe game is divided into \u201cchapters\u201d which are split into very small levels, usually the size of one screen each. There are also several air levels in which Hardboiled Chicken flies on his jetpack. Most of the time, though, he walks through penguin military bases, climbing, hiding, solving puzzles, and shooting the guards on his way with various firearms. This is where the game\u2019s \u201cchildish\u201d visual style and tongue-in-cheek humor contrast its bloody action. There\u2019s a co-op mode for two players that mostly uses the same maps but is based on a different plot about a kidnapped general&#39;s daughter.  <br />\nRocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken is most famous for music. Many intros, animated cutscenes and even some of the levels are set to synth rock music by the Austrian band New World Revolution.</p>"

This, in turn, would affect the outcome of further cases. However, with the cases not being firmly tied down together, the impact of player&#39;s mistakes is insignificant.

Gameplay-wise, it\u2019s a regular 2D shoot \u2019em up in space, not unlike Asteroids or Project Starfighter. The player controls a small starship that fires at everything on the screen, from asteroids to enemy spacecraft, in order to survive. When hit by an obstacle or by enemy fire, the ship explodes. The goal is to survive as long as possible and score more points to unlock bonuses and receive ranks.<br />\nWhat makes gameplay in Beat Hazard innovative is that every level is based on a song from the player\u2019s music collection. The song defines the speed and rhythm of the game. A similar approach was previously used in Audiosurf, but never before in a shoot \u2019em up. Enemy attacks, your ship\u2019s fire, and power-ups are synchronized to the song and can be predicted if you remember the tune well. The difficulty is also dependent on music. A power ballad or an ambient piece will do for a slow, meditative play, while a trance or heavy metal composition will turn the game into madness. The game\u2019s visuals are very bright and feature many rapid flashes, which makes Beat Hazard not recommended for people with epilepsy.</p>"

The game design feature of the game is an absence of bars with the actions, usually to the genre. Gameplay only allows speaking with the other characters, choosing the corresponding emotional reaction (much like a dialogue wheel in Mass Effect series) and connect objects within the inventory. <br />\nThe story follows Lilli \u2014 the protagonist of the game. The setting is the female school in some Abbey. After the news of a probable brainwash, the main character and some other pupils decide to expose corrupted school officials. The story, like this, tracks themes of a problematic youth, father-and-son issues, and adolescent disobedience. The game features three endings: the player is free to choose any one with their choices not affecting the outcome.</p>"

It was marketed as the last game in the series. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Nine years have passed after the infamous Shadow Moses incident. The world is torn apart by local conflicts. Nations hire private military corporations instead of having their own armies. The  War Economy emerges with the Sons Of the Patriots system controlling the PMCs. Soldiers are infused with nanomachines that control their behavior on the battlefield, and the weapons are ID-locked. Liquid Ocelot sets out to hijack the system to use in his own interests. Solid Snake grows old rapidly and gets ready for his last mission in order to kill Liquid and save the world once again.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Snake is proficient in Close quarters combat and stealth infiltration. Players are deployed on the battlefield with a wide arrange of gadgets at their disposal, such as the OctoCamo that allows for replicating any surface the player is close to or a Solid Eye that serves as the game&#39;s HUD. It is essential to keep an eye on Snake&#39;s stress level. As the protagonist&#39;s stress level increases, it gets harder to aim, Snake suffers more damage, and it is easier to get knocked out in hand-to-hand combat.</p>\n<p>A VR mode is also present in the game where players can learn about the weapons they can use and master the CQC.</p>"

The arenas of the game are procedurally generated and contain environmental hazards. Due to problems related to finding other players in multiplayer mode, Gun Monkeys was removed from Steam. <br />\nGun Monkeys was originally released at a price of $9.99 yet later due to various problems, the price was dropped to $5.99 and was bundled in a pack of two games from which one was as a gift for a friend. <br />\nThe reception from critics for the game was mixed.

        "description": "<p>Hellpoint is a dark sci fi action RPG set in the aftermath of a massive quantum cataclysm. Every living being quickly lost their mind as their memories and bodies were merged with alternate versions of themselves from parallel universes. The accident also attracted entities of immense power that should have been left alone, in the depth of other dimensions.<br />\nYou play as a mysterious nameless character whose intentions are entirely determined by your choices. You wake up in the derelict Irid Novo space station, in orbit around a super-massive black hole.<br />\nIn the game, the space station orbits in real time around the ominous black hole. Its position in the sky directly impacts the sanity of the inhabitants of the station. The singularity is doing more than simply distorting the fabric of space and time; based on the time of the orbit, enemies in the levels get crazier or struck by fear, unknown entities roam the corridors and dozens of other mysterious events can occur.<br />\nHellpoint is based on a peculiar structure called the Quantic System. It is a series of interconnected systems that are utilizing a server clock to decide when and where a particular dynamic event should occur. You can see a preview of that system in our demo linked below. You venture in a corridor that you previously walked through, and suddenly a new passage is opened. A tall menacing mini-boss is now patrolling where there was no one before. Enemies cower in fear as you approach them, or charge you in a fit of rage. A boss suddenly grows tougher and more aggressive, but also drops more valuable loot. It is up to you to figure out what events happen where and when so that you can exploit them to your advantage.<br />\nIn Hellpoint, the Black Hole is truly the master of the dungeon.<br />\nIrid Novo was once a shining beacon of intergalactic collaboration, built to research advanced artificial intelligence and quantum mechanics. Now, it is a dark and dangerous place dominated by the will of the cosmic gods. It is best to explore Irid Novo with the help of a friend.<br />\nHellpoint supports splitscreen co-op and player versus player on all platforms. You can play the whole game with a friend, or have him jump up in and out anytime he likes. The loot is shared, and the experience of player two is saved and not watered down. In our youth, we&#39;ve had countless nights of couch gaming fun, playing with friends and siblings until the sun rose. With Hellpoint, we want to bring back couch gaming into a genre that we think cruelly lacks it.<br />\nFor centuries, the galaxy has been at peace. With the discovery of interstellar travel and the access to infinite resources that ensued, brutal wars are now a thing of the past. To survive the wrath of cosmic gods and hordes of monsters, you will have to find ancient blueprints and craft long forgotten weapons and armors and acquire forbidden powers. You play the way you want, will it be a sword and a shield, or a firearm and your mastery over the cosmic energies?<br />\nHellpoint allows you to play the way you want. Using our crafting and customization system, you can adjust your weapons and powers according to your own play style. Do you prefer your healing power to heal more over time or instantaneously? Go edit your power in one of the crafting station, and make it work the way you like. Would you prefer your energy missiles to explode on impact, or to ricochet off enemies? The choice is yours to modify them as you see fit.<br />\nThe more you fight with a weapon, the more proficient you become with it and eventually you unlock powerful abilities. This can go from an extra long range combo attack to a shattering explosion that sends enemies flying.<br />\nA terrible quantum cataclysm happened on board Irid Novo and is spreading to the whole multiverse. Piercing the very fabric of space to reach parallel universes is not something mortals should be allowed to play with. However, those breaches into other universes could very well be the key for you to make things right...<br />\nEvery time you start a new game, the station is different. Rooms, enemies, puzzles, events, all are parts of the multiverse. This means that while our level design is carefully hand crafted, no two games are exactly the same. The game stay fresh as you never know what to except around the corner. As you die, you are pulled away from your universe of origin, and you wake up into the next. The more you die, the more the world changes around you.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Winter Assault is the first expansion for Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War. It\u2019s a real-time strategy about the war on the planet of Lorn V. The expansion added new maps and the Imperial Guard race to the game and simplified some game mechanics and units.</p>\n<p>You can take control of one of five races: Orks, Eldar, Chaos, Space Marines, and the Imperial Guard. The plot is divided into the Order storyline and the Disorder storyline, represented by different races. No matter what path you choose, the game starts with the confrontation of these sides; you have to deal with the consequences of their battle and make decisions that will affect the story.</p>\n<p>The game features such classic RTS aspects as building a base and technology development. However, the gameplay focuses on tactics. Every race in the game has its unique units you can use during missions. As a rule, it\u2019s not the entire army that takes part in battles, but a limited amount of units. To be efficient you need to manage these units separately.</p>"

Expect plot twists, irreverent humor, cameos and borderline trademark infringing scenarios as you complete the 50+ levels. With party mode you&#39;ll be able to compete for the highest score locally or against the community.<br />\nGuided by narrator Mick \u201cRicePirate\u201d Lauer players will learn the ropes in a series of increasingly precarious and fantastical instructional lessons.

So, whether on a heist or doing a repo job, load as much into the truck as possible before zooming off to the next gig. How freight gets from one place to another is entirely up to players, though, so toss the manual out the window and get creative. Break down the walls, throw things, and use technology like portals and ray guns across more than 50 levels. Anything goes, as long as the work gets done!<br />\nEnjoy the game solo as an independent contractor or team up with a friend or loved one. Moving Out features both local and online play across its arcade, story, and versus modes. Each level also adjusts the experience dynamically to account for the number of players on screen, thereby welcoming Smooth Move employees of all ages and skill levels.<br />\nMoving Out is currently in development as the premiere title from SMG\u2019s Melbourne studio and is made in collaboration with Stockholm-based developer Devm Games.</p>"

Like its predecessor, it was also commercially successful, breaking sales records in the United Kingdom.<br />\nThe game entails tuning cars for street races, resuming the Need for Speed: Underground storyline. Need for Speed: Underground 2 provides several new features, such as a broader customization, new methods of selecting races, the &quot;explore&quot; mode (similar to the Midnight Club series, in a large city known as &quot;Bayview&quot;). The City Center was based on Philadelphia, Beacon Hill was based on Beverly Hills and Coal Harbor was based on Camden, New Jersey, and Bayview as a whole is a microcosm of the west coast of the United States. Underground 2 also introduces several SUVs, which could be customized as extensively as other Underground 2 vehicles and used to race against other SUV racers. Brooke Burke is the voice of Rachel Teller, the person who guides the player throughout the game.<br />\nThe game has been ported to PlayStation Portable, under the title of Need for Speed: Underground Rivals. The Nintendo DS port introduces a new feature in which the player is able to design custom decals to adorn any vehicle in the game.</p>"

Each player controls a team of 4 or fewer worms and can control one worm at a time, moving around, using items and attacking in a set amount of time. Then after each player moved and attacked in turn with all of their characters round starts over, and the game goes until only one player or a team left. There\u2019s an option for players to play a single player campaign and challenges, from the previous Worms 3D games, or a match against bots with an improved AI.

Combat Mages inflict damage to the enemy with the magic of fire, lightning, death, curses. They can also summon magical creatures - with the appropriate tasks. Each magician can also impose auras of improvement (&quot;buffs&quot;) and deterioration (&quot;debuffs&quot;) on himself, his team or enemies.</p>"

The story unravels rapidly, and the players have to save the whole kingdom.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Dungeon Siege is played from a top-down third-person perspective. At the beginning of the game, the players create a character to play as. On his way, the main character finds new comrades that can join his party. Seven other characters can join the player&#39;s party and are controlled by the artificial intelligence. The players can switch between the characters in this party at any gameplay moment. </p>\n<p>The game features a seamless open world. The players encounter numerous monsters on their path, and their party defends themselves. There is no character class system in the game. Instead, if the player uses a certain item for a long time, their handling skill of it will increase. Such a system was later implemented in The Elder Scrolls IV: Skyrim. After leveling up, the players gain a base stat increase. </p>\n<p>The game features an inventory system, represented as a grid, where the items take space and can be rotated and placed differently in the inventory to save some space. </p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>The game features a cooperative experience for eight players. It is possible to play through the game&#39;s main storyline or engage in a horde mode on a specific multiplayer map.</p>"

Manipulate the time can not only Commander Repeatski, but also ordinary soldiers - they, too, can &quot;rewind&quot; the time forward or backward - for example, during the fight, &quot;cancel&quot; the wrong decision, be five minutes earlier and do everything as needed.<br />\nAnd one more useful thing is the slow motion mode, if at normal speed it is difficult to pass.<br />\nThe player has 30 lives.

It is an RTS game.</p>\n<p>Two years pass after the Black Sun weapon was fired. The president of the United Earth Federation was murdered. The Seraphim occupy Earth. The old enemies unite to fight back the alien race. </p>\n<p>The gameplay does not differ much from the original Supreme Commander. The main feature of the game is still the number of the vehicles featured. Players can fight on land, air, and water. The game also features various stationary buildings and experimental units that can withstand a massive amount of damage.</p>\n<p>There are two types of resources in the game: Mass and Energy. Both of them are essential for the development of the player&#39;s army and economy. It does not matter how much materials you have for your future expansion. The speed you gather them at is what&#39;s important. One of the core mechanics of the game is the mining of Mass from the destroyed units and buildings while Energy can be obtained from trees and unfinished buildings.</p>"

In the last days of the summer holidays, twelve-year-old juggler Jerry Hazelnut finds a recipe for a secret formula with which can create a carrot flame. Mixing all the ingredients, Jerry stumbles upon mysterious suitcase. Inside is a magic wand and hat, which later turns into a white rabbit. His name is Marquis de Hoto, and he tells Jerry about the existence of an infinite number of parallel universes.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The gameplay is based on the basic principles of point-and-click adventure games: the player controls the main character with the mouse, manipulates objects from the inventory and tries to solve with their help puzzles. The items can be used by themselves or mixed before use. Jerry has a special coin that can find hidden magic. Its usage also highlights all usable objects on the screen which significantly simplifies the game. In addition to other items, on the game levels are scattered collectibles, like stickers and audiobooks. They almost do not affect the gameplay, but by collecting them, the player can get an achievement on Steam and some information about the game world.</p>"

It is the second game in the series.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>In 1972, a technological marvel emerged in North Korea. The APEX corporation was found. Sometime later, the North Korean technologies become more widespread than the US. In 2004 the United States began to buy its weaponry from Korea. By 2016 the United States economy is at an all-time low, the US invade the Middle East. In 2025, the US debt to North Korea grows too immense to be paid out, and the economy crumbles. While being helpful at first, North Korea&#39;s military set foot on the American soil. You become a part of the resistance based in Philadelphia in 2029 trying to set the city free from Korean People&#39;s Army.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The players have to use the insurgency strategies in order to free the city of Philadelphia from the KPA. A wide set of explosives, jammers, and traps is available to the player. It is possible to modify the weapons the player has on the go. Attach suppressors, scopes or convert your weapon entirely as you see fit. </p>\n<p>Philadelphia is split into three zones: the Green Zone where the KPA and their collaborators live in comfort with stable electricity supply and clean drinking water; the Yellow Zone which serves as a ghetto for most of the Philadelphia residents; the Red Zone which mostly consists of bombed-out suburbs of Philly. </p>\n<p>A four-player co-op mode is present in the game and is separated from the main campaign.</p>"

Realizing the boy is in grave danger, Paul arrives at Ethan\u2019s home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to be even worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal murder, which Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth looking into.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the weird fiction (and other tales of the macabre) from the early twentieth century, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter aims to significantly evolve immersive storytelling in games. While it features a private detective and quite a few mental challenges, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not an especially puzzle-ridden game. Our focus is on atmosphere, mood, and the essential humanity of our characters.</p>\n<p>Still, the discoveries won\u2019t happen on their own, or without your help.

The game was created by three teams: Crytek Kiev, Crytek Seoul, and Crytek UK. The game uses the power of Crytek\u2019s own engine - CryEngine 3. Initially, the game was aimed at the Asian market but was also released in the west.</p>\n<p>The game features more than two hundred weapons: from the vintage Mosin rifle to modern models like the Bushmaster BA50. There are no licenses for thorough weapon replication, but virtual models are based on real prototypes. All weapons can be modified. The game has four main classes: Sniper, Rifleman, Engineer, and Medic. Each has its own distinctiveness and unique gameplay: Medic, for example, is an exceptionally supportive class, which can bring back to life the fallen soldiers.</p>\n<p>There are two main opposing groups in the game: Warface and Blackwood. The first is a private military organization that opposes the attempts of the latter to seize control of resources around the world, sell weapons and stops the killing of civilians. The game has many thematic events thanks to which game&#39;s lore is developing.</p>"

        "description": "<h3>The experiment</h3>\n<p>Experimental side-scrolling fighting game for two players developed and published by the Messhof studio. Players compete in fencing in the pixelated game world. Despite the simplicity of the concept and of the controls, the game is very competitive, and many media called the game one of the best multiplayer experience of 2014. The name is consonant with serpent from the Norse mythology N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr, the snake appears in the game, eating the winner of the duel. The game draws inspiration from the game, which was released in 1984 - Great Swordsman, and for development used software GameMaker: Studio, which is available on Steam. Who wouldn\u2019t want to create a game where you impale a friend, eh? </p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>Players get control over two game models that differ only in color. Controls are standard: jump, move, slide and throw the sword at your opponent. You can attack at three different heights: high, medium and low. Hit the opponent&#39;s sword to disarm the latter, and he will have to raise the sword again. The main task is to reach the end of the enemy territory. The first player who accomplished this wins. There are four different levels available for solo, local and online multiplayer. Later, the developers added new modes, like a tournament and the ability to use weapons differently.</p>"

It is the debut project of the game.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game is set in a \u201cdark fairytale\u201d kingdom of Armello, where the anthropomorphic animals from many clans live. The king has gone crazy and is slowly dying because of the dark force named the Rot. The representatives of several factions come to the kingdom&#39;s capital to become the new king. Four characters are present at the beginning of the game: Tane the wolf, Amber the rabbit, Mercurio the rat, and Sanah, the bear. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Armello is a digital remake of a traditional fantasy tabletop role-playing game in which there are rolling dice and cards, that allows the players to execute certain actions. The gaming area is divided into hexagonal plates, that contain procedurally generated features like caves, buildings, other characters or pieces of equipment. As the game progresses, the players can buy in-game currency to purchase special abilities using the skill tree, that is unique to every character.</p>\n<p>The game uses a turn-based system, where the players can equip new items or acquire new skills while the other players make their turn. The cards and dice are used only when the players directly interact with the in-game world. The players use cards for casting spells, hiring teammates, treating wounds or using the special items that grant temporary abilities.</p>"

The bridge has to be strong enough for several vehicles to pass it, let alone the bridge has to hold its own weight.</p>\n<p>The game does not disable physics after the player is finished with building up the bridge, as each vehicle present in the game has its own weight and length, so the player-built structure has to be adaptive in some cases. For example, long vehicles, such as cargo trucks, will not be able to ride on steep constructions, so the bridge has to adjust itself based on the weight of the vehicle. </p>\n<p>There are also several obstacles for the player-built bridges present in the game, as sometimes a boat can spawn on the level and try to swim under the bridge. Storms are also a vital part of the gameplay, as the players have to also take into the amount the power of wind and adjust their creation as well.</p>\n<p>The main catch of the game is that the players do not have unlimited resources, so they will have to make the best out the things at hand. Several types of materials are present in the game with each material having a certain amount of strength. The river gets wider and wider as the player progresses through the game, as well as the number of vehicles that have to pass the bridge for level completion.</p>"

The game was fancied to be a new generation Crash Bandicoot, it released simultaneously with the PS4 console and was provided bundled in some regions. <br />\nGameplay centers around its self-titled protagonist whose primary ability is to disintegrate into little pieces called Relics and absorb various materials to be its parts. Thus Knack may turn into ice- iron- and crystal Knack getting bigger and smaller depending on the number of respectable materials within him. Other than that Knack is a usual beat them up: the player will be dodging, jumping, punching and kicking enemies in various fashions. <br />\nThe game tells a story of a high-end world populated with advanced humans who have discovered the powers of Relics to compose Knack-like creatures and goblins who are presented as a lower race continually trying to start a war or rob humans.</p>"

Slay the armies of darkness in the dungeons below the Old Cathedral and save the terror-stricken Paperverse from the clutches of the Archdemon himself. The game is the first installment of Return 2 Games - a series of original mid-core titles, inspired by the early golden days of PC gaming.Decide the length of quests!Have only 5 minutes for a game? No problem! Book of Demons allows you to set the length of each quest, thanks to our Flexiscope\u2122 system. It learns your way of playing and gives you the best experience, making Book of Demons the first truly accessible hack &amp; slash!Build your own deck of devastating skills!Collect powerful skill cards, combine them depending on the enemies you&#39;re facing and assemble your favorite set of devastating powers! But be warned: efficiency of each card will greatly depend on the situation you&#39;re in, so be prepared to make constant adjustments!Relive the classic with a good laugh!Book of Demons is a universal tale of good and evil about saving the world from total destruction and ultimate devilry! Sounds familiar? Well, how about retelling the story in a different way, with a humorous twist of a parody?Be a part of a one-of-a-kind adventure!Never explore the same dungeon twice - in Book of Demons every level is a procedurally generated, randomly-populated adventure of its own! You won&#39;t get bored by the diversity of monsters either - there are over 70 kinds of creatures waiting to be slain: lurking scorpions, snake archers, mad goatmen, not-so-sexy succubi... you get the idea.Hack &amp; slash in the world of Paperverse!Book of Demons is indeed a dark fantasy hack &amp; slash, but unlike other action role-playing games, it&#39;s set in the pop-up book world of Paperverse. The paper-cut universe is one of the hallmarks of Return 2 Games - a series of mid-core games, inspired by the early golden days of PC gaming. Book of Demons is the first installment of the Return 2 Games series.Looking for even more challenge?Slaying the Archdemon won&#39;t be the end of the story. In Book of Demons, you can master the campaign with 3 different classes (Warrior, Rogue or Mage), revisit your favorite quests in Freeplay mode or rise to the challenge and explore the dungeons on higher difficulty levels (the last one is called Massacre, with good reason).</p>"

All missions in the game are divided into three campaigns. Each campaign takes place in one of three locations: Stalingrad, Central Europe, Normandy.<br />\nEach mission traditionally includes several tasks. The nature of the tasks is about the same as in the other games of the series: the destruction of objects, equipment, snipers, spies and commanders of the enemy, the protection of our soldiers and officers.<br />\nThe game has a lot of new weapons and equipment. All this exactly corresponds to the real models of armaments of that time. As a result, the set of weapons and equipment in the game has become significantly more diverse and includes even mortars, motorcycles, jeeps. Another notable innovation: the review system now allows you to rotate the camera in all directions and scale the landscape.</p>"

It is a part of a large Forza series including 11 titles in it with Horizon 3 being the 9th heading in the row. It is, however, uncertain to claim that there is a unified narrative in racing games, so all 11 titles more likely represent one universe, but do not come in specific order.<br />\nAs mentioned earlier, the title series does not follow a distinct storyline. Speaking of surroundings, nonetheless, it is safe to say, that the Horizon 3&#39;s scene is an Australia. The previous chapters of racing have pushed a narrative about the players being a participator of Horizon Festival. Now the protagonist becomes a host of the event, so they must play organizing roles, too. For example, hire drivers and adjust the racing grounds.<br />\nThere are some events players can be a part of.  For example, drifting competition, Bucket List challenges and time trials. All of them utilize the same mechanics of getting to the finish line as fast as possible. There are more than 350 cars available, let alone DLC ones. 4-person co-op included along with multiplatform races between PC and Xbox One.</p>"

The plot develops linearly. The developers use story-in-story method to tell two parallel telling two stories of two heroes. The camera in the game is in such a position that the player feels like an observer of the game world. To direct characters to a certain point on a screen it is necessary to click there. Clicking is also helping with interacting with objects, the characters comment on their possible use of items, and this is somewhat simplifying the task of the player.</p>\n<p>The game tries to connect the classic point-and-click gameplay with the mysterious setting and features of The Dark Eye RPG universe.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Unepic is a 2D platformer game with role-playing elements. The story follows Daniel, a sci-fi, and video games geek that one day was teleported into a fantasy world and found himself in a giant castle. The game\u2019s dialogues, storyline, and aesthetics heavily relies on humor with a lot of geek-culture references and mocking on sci-fi and fantasy clich\u00e9s.  <br />\nThe gameplay can be described as a mix of 2D Metroidvania and role-playing game. The RPG elements in the game include acquiring levels, skills-points, and equipment. There are many types of armor and weapons in the that require the absolute level and skills to be used. The fighting mechanics are pretty simple and don\u2019t have a lot of moves and abilities. Unlike many other metroidvanias, in Unepic you open new parts of the game world not by acquiring new abilities that let you go to the places you couldn\u2019t reach before, but rather by collecting keys that unlock doors in different parts of the castle.</p>"

Residents are also divided into six classes, differing in income, needs and transport preferences.<br />\nThe second game differs from the first by the absence of a helicopter as a mode of transport, the ability to build roads, the change of day and night, the introduction of depots instead of simple ring lines, and also the presence of a multi-player mode.<br />\nThe player is provided with a data collection system that informs about people&#39;s places of residence and work, the functions of buildings, the number of stowaways and so on.<br />\nThe &quot;sandbox&quot; mode allows you to operate with unlimited resources and the ability to arbitrarily change any parameter, cancel all restrictions. Campaign class modes have specific tasks, even a few, and only the execution of tasks opens the next campaign. Each campaign corresponds to a separate city, there are only six of them.</p>"

Final Fantasy XIII\u2019s main character Lightning, appears only as a supporting character, while the story follows her sister, Serah Farron, and a new character Noel Kreiss. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay is almost identical to that of the original game. The battle system is presented as Command Synergy Battle. It is based on usage of Action Time Battle bar: the bar consists of several slots that are used to perform attacks or cast spells and gradually refills during the battle. <br />\nHowever, the game has some significant differences compared to the original game. The areas are more opened and endorse exploration. The party consists only of two characters, while the third spot is reserved for tamed monsters. The game also uses a random encounter system from previous installments.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The storyline follows the events of the XIII. They, however, do not connect to the other Final Fantasies so any chapter of the series may be played in unspecified order. The protagonists of the game are six youngsters who are trying to prevent the end of the world.</p>"

Game events begin in 1066, but there are often no time limits, so theoretically, missions can last dozens and even hundreds of game years.</p>\n<h3>The path of war and the path of peace</h3>\n<p>The game allows you to build - a settlement or a castle, carry out individual economic missions or just build freely, and destroy - invade the country, take the castle under siege or, on the contrary, crush the attackers. You can create your own maps and play in multiplay mode.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>You are the ruler of the castle, you are responsible for both the economy and the war. Do not forget about the popularity - it&#39;s a separate indicator in the game.</p>\n<p>You can build six types of buildings:<br />\nthe castle and everything inside it - walls, towers, gates, barracks, ditches, etc.,<br />\nsawmills, quarries, mines and other structures for extraction of resources - wood, stone, iron and oil.<br />\nFarms that bring meat, milk, wheat, apples, hops, skins of cows,<br />\ncity \u200b\u200bbuildings - houses, churches, wells,<br />\nWeapon workshops, where they produce weapons and armor,<br />\nBarns and shops for cheese, bread, ale</p>\n<p>Buildings are built instantly, it is only necessary to make such a decision. Just as quickly your soldiers are trained. But all this requires money obtained from the collection of taxes and trade.</p>\n<p>To succeed in the economy it is not enough just to make calculations. We have to cope with unpredictable disasters like the invasion of rabbits or fire.</p>\n<p>The war is fought by soldiers of close combat and distant combat: archers, crossbowmen, pikemen, swordsmen, spearmen, knights and even monks with clubs.</p>\n<p>Troops can shoot from towers, move around walls, destroy walls, use siege machines, including towers, while besieged have boiling resin tanks, pits with stakes and moats with water. You can dig trenches and even organize an epidemic in the enemy camp. For complex actions, except soldiers, you need to involve sappers and engineers.</p>\n<h3>Addition Stronghold Crusader HD</h3>\n<p>Expands the set of game situations with the stories of the Crusades:<br />\nThe first crusade of 1094-1099,<br />\nSaladin&#39;s campaigns of 1187,<br />\nthe expedition of Richard the Lionheart, Friedrich Barbarossa and the French Philip II in order to liberate Jerusalem</p>\n<p>The way of the crusader is a campaign of 50 cards not tied to historical events, but in the same setting.</p>\n<p>One of the unique innovations are the assassins - the warriors of special abilities, able to invisibly enter the castle and open the gate from the inside, interrupting the guard.</p>"

The game was made because the game sold poorly and wasn&#39;t met with critical acclaim.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game takes place in  Eorzea five years after the events of the original game. FINAL FANTASY XIV ended on an apocalyptic note - a dragon god destroyed most of the Eorzea. Thanks to the blessing of the Gods, the player-created characters were able to escape certain death and were sent five years to the future. In a rebuilt world they face the danger of invasion by the Empire of the north.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>In FFXIV, the players interact with each other in a world that continues to live on even without any players on the server. At the beginning of the game, the players are met by a character creation screen where they choose the name, race, gender, build, appearance and the base class. It is also necessary to choose a game world for your character. </p>\n<p>Players level up their characters by gaining EXP. EXP is gained by raiding dungeons, taking part in server-wide events, killing monsters, and completing quests.</p>\n<p>The game&#39;s combat system revolves around using a combination of character-specific weapon skills, the use of magic, and the physical attacks themselves.</p>"

It\u2019s a first-person adventure game about a young boy named Monroe, who recently lost his mother, famous artist known for not finishing a painting, adding up to the number of her incomplete works. And out of all her works, Monroe is permitted to keep only one favorite, a swan with a missing neck. And one night he wakes up to see the swan escape, and after the short chase players will find themselves in a painted unfinished world, finding the missing swan.<br />\nOver the course of the game, players will use a magic silver brush to spread the black paint over the blank and completely white environment, to locate a way to progress and solutions to puzzles, while the narrator tells a story of a Lonely King. Most of the environments and the painting tool are used to show players, that Unfinished Swan is more of a narrative experience, where puzzles are not stopping your progress entirely, but act as an obstacle. There is no active combat in the game, so the actions of the player will wholly dictate the pace and completion.</p>"

There is an anti-gravity gun to do this \u2014 other than that it is just a general side-scroller platforming gameplay: the player needs to eliminate enemies, collect orbs to discover new planets and solve various physics puzzles.<br />\nThe story is about the robot, BEEP, , sent into the Solar System to discover new planets and the possibility of life there. Once the Beep has unraveled the new planet, he checks on its physics and flies over to the next one.</p>"

The game has different endings depending on your choices.</p>\n<p>The protagonist is fully customizable. You can upgrade his abilities according to your style during non-linear missions and multiple quests. It\u2019s on you to focus either on stealth or pushing - as the character\u2019s body is mechanically enhanced, you can develop it any way you want. Moreover, you have \u201cnine lives\u201d: after the first nine deaths you will respawn immediately where you were killed, and only the tenth death will throw you back to the checkpoint.</p>"

Presented in-game future is dark, mostly due to the fact that life is possible only deep underground, in caves and crevices. In order to prevent the full extinction of all life forms of the face of the earth, some people invented the time machine that will help to locate the beginning of the chain of events that brought their world to ruin. Fay, one of the few time travelers, has to convince Bent Svenson, that his recent discovery of bacteria based biofuel is the only key to the survival of the planet in the future. <br />\nNew Beginning consists of 11 chapters, where the player will control Fay or Ben. It is not possible to switch between characters interactively, but the story and gameplay are direct and straightforward. Final Cut was brought to the Steam 3 times and met rejection because Valve Corp. considered their target audience not interested in the genre in general, but Daedalic Entertainment succeeded and brought the entire line of their products to the platform.</p>"
