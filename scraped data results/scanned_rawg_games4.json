Get in, kill the guards, solve puzzles, get out.</p>\n<p>Cabal.wad<br />\nOnce upon a time, you were the biggest and the angriest cyberdemon in existence. You were the head of the council that ruled Hell, at least you were before you were betrayed. Go out there and get revenge.</p>\n<p>Inferno.wad<br />\nAfter all the trouble you&#39;ve gone through at the UAC facility, you&#39;ve lost track of your girlfriend Beatrice. It&#39;s no mystery how you got separated with all the demons running around. Go back to Hell and get her out.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>This expansion pack brought no changes to Doom II&#39;s gameplay. Every aspect of the game stayed largely the same.</p>\n<p>The main objective of Doom 2 is to find an exit off the level to continue to the next one, killing any demon you find on your way. Many weapons are at your disposal, such as a shotgun, a double-barrelled super-shotgun, and last, but not least, the iconic chainsaw. </p>\n<p>There is no health regen in the game. Instead, the players have to look for medkits on the level they are in at the moment.</p>"

It serves as a sequel to Lugaru, another title by the company.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>On a fictional island of Lugaru, after many years after the extinction of humanity, the world is run by humanoid wolves, rabbits, rats, cats, and dogs.</p>\n<p>Most of Overgrowth&#39;s plot is not revealed yet, as the game is still in early access stage of production. The main character was carried over from the previous game. A rabbit named Turner that avenged his family by killing the Alpha wolf and a corrupt king. Turner refused to become the next king and left to explore the island.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Similar to the previous game, Overgrowth puts a strong emphasis on hand-to-hand combat. Attacks and counter-attacks are based on timing and contextual actions rather than the usual combos. </p>\n<p>The game features an advanced physics-based animation system which allows for seamless transitions between animations. Every animation will be different based on the environment, the character&#39;s mood and even individual traits. </p>\n<p>Levels in Overgrowth introduce the players to their environment, tasks, and means of completing such tasks. Despite that, the players are free to explore the level as they see fit. This allows the players to find their own path to level completion. </p>\n<p>The game features a sophisticated AI. The enemy characters can attack from the back or get together for an ambush. If the AI decides that it has no chance of winning, the enemies fall back.</p>"

It can be described as the mix of modern Europe and futuristic setting with high fantasy influences. The game follows six main heroes, five of which are members of the elite military organization called SeeD, on their quest to defeat Ultimecia, an evil sorceress who wishes to compress time. Like its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII, the game heavily focuses on its story, characters and game world exposure.  </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay of Final Fantasy VIII shares many similarities with other JRPGs of that era. The player can explore the overworld, visit different locations such as town, settlements, forests, interact with NPCs and fight numerous types of monsters in turn-based battles.<br />\nWhile the world exploration aspect, for the most part, is similar to that of the previous game, the battle system has several notable differences. The combat in the game is centered on Junction system that allows the player to junction summoned monsters known as Guardian Forces to platy members. That gives characters the ability to use various magic, alter their stats and draw spells from enemies during the battles. Because of the system\u2019s flexibility regarding character customization, the game is absent of job system typical for the series.</p>"

        "description": "GET READY TO ENTER A NEW ERA OF PHYSICS PLATFORMING Polyball is a modern take on classic ball rolling games such as Super Monkey Ball, Marble Madness, and Marble Blast - while taking cues from games such as the Sonic series, Trials, and Mario Kart.A BIT ABOUT US...The first full release from digital design practice Studio Monolith, Polyball is an experiment in low-poly visuals and open-ended game design. Our approach with the project was to make the kind of game we used to play, something that had both casual appeal and a limitless competitive ceiling. It was also a genre that we felt hasn't been adequately adapted to the modern world of game design. Our vision was simple: build a game that's easy to pick up, hard to master, and fun both on and off screen....AND A BIT ABOUT POLYBALLThere's a lot to do in Polyball -- Challenge yourself or a friend to one of over 60 levels included in the initial release, with plans for many more levels via <strong>free</strong> DLC. If you've got some friends over and are looking for something to play, <strong>Polyball's</strong> splitscreen multiplayer promises a good time. With classic modes like <strong>Battle</strong> and <strong>Circuit Race</strong>, as well as a multiplayer version of the single-player experience, Polyball promises to be a must-have party game.CASUAL, COMPETITIVE, OR BOTHWith global leaderboards built right into the level select menu and pregame screen, you can see where you stand among the worlds best and race against their ghosts. If you're more interested in beating your friends, check out the friends-only leaderboards. Collecting shards during your single-player journey will unlock a vast array of customization options, from different ball models to particle effects. This customization carries over into online multiplayer matches as well as your high-score ghost, with local multiplayer having its own version of the customization system designed for split-screen play.FOR THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLEIf you've mastered every challenge we put into the game, take a look at the Steam Workshop content to face a whole new set of challenges. Community made content, from multiplayer battle maps and circuit tracks to customization options and single-player levels, will bridge the gap between developer and player as well as provide a steady stream of new content for you to experience. Steam Workshop gives the players a voice, allowing for the mechanics and level designs of Polyball to stretch far beyond what we had initially put into the game.FEATURES<br/><ul><li> 60+ levels and free DLC<br/></li><li> Powerful customization system<br/></li><li> Full controller support<br/></li><li> Extensive multiplayer support - online/splitscreen<br/></li><li> Global/Friends Leaderboards<br/></li><li> Full soundtrack made by independent artists<br/></li><li> Steam Workshop<br/></li><li> Tuned mechanics and balanced levels based on community feedback<br/></li><li> Mac/Windows/Linux support<br/></li><li> Alternate language localization<br/></li><li> Ghosts<br/></li><li> Steam Cloud Saves</li></ul>MULTIPLAYER MODES<br/><ul><li> Trails<br/></li><li> Battle<br/></li><li> Circuit Race<br/></li><li> Tower Climb<br/></li><li> Split-Screen + Online Story Mode<br/></li><li> Many more!</li></ul><br/>Please be sure to check the Early Access tab to see the current state of the game."

The world of the game is only restricted by traveling from one city to another, while the cities themselves are free to explore. The plot is expressed in the form of various missions, where the playable character receives general instructions through a phone call, or otherwise. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Each mission in the game has a set goal of in-game points, awarded for successful completion of mission\u2019s requirements, and sometimes causing mayhem for the sake of it. Completion of these missions allows the player to move on to more difficult tasks, and eventually, another chapter in other cities. The player often has to steal vehicles, sell them for profit, perform roadkills and escape the police, as the number of attempts for each mission is limited.</p>\n<h3>Graphics and reception</h3>\n<p>The game features a simplistic style for graphics, sacrificing different animations and sprites in favor of just being fun to play. At the time of release, in late 1997-1998, Grand Theft Auto offered unique arcade gameplay with an open world, where players could do anything they wanted, which, of course, was the key to overwhelming success of the game.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Dante&#39;s Inferno is a slasher role-playing game developed by Visceral game.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game is loosely based on the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. The players control Dante, a veteran of crusades, looks for his beloved Beatrice who got taken by Lucifer. As Dante descends deeper into Hell, he has to face more and more horrific creatures, his own sins and the dark history of his family.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay of Dante&#39;s Inferno is similar to most slayer games. The core mechanics of the genre are to control a character who traverses different locations and eliminates every enemy they find on their path (demons in this case). The protagonist&#39;s weapons are long-ranged, allowing for the mass murder of their enemies. </p>\n<p>The boss battles in the game are heavily inspired by God of War, where the player firstly fights with the boss and later uses a quick-time event to finish their enemy off. </p>\n<p>Multiple platforming puzzles are present in the game. The levels itself consist of multiple interconnected platforms. There are numerous spots where the players have to jump to, not without using their weapons on several occasions. </p>\n<p>Two weapons are present in the game: the Death&#39;s Scythe and a Holy Cross, which differ both in their usage and their role in the game&#39;s character progression system. Both weapons have their own upgrade trees which require souls. Souls can be acquired by killing enemies with one of the weapons.</p>"

This world has different geography and history, albeit its countries and cultures are based on prototypes from our real world. Skies Unknown follows the Lighthouse War (also called the Second Continental War) a conflict between the Kingdom of Erusea and the Osean Federation in an alternate 2019. The goal of the war is to control the International Space Elevator. The Erusean army attacks the Osean military that protected the Elevator. In response, Osea launches a large-scale attack against Farbanti, Erusea&#39;s capital city, causing massive loss of civilian lives.</p>\n<h3>Main characters</h3>\n<p>The main protagonist in the Skies Unknown story campaign is Trigger, a pilot in the Osean Air Force. He was framed for murder and transferred to the penal squadron. While the player starts as an Osean military, the game does not favor any side in the conflict. Rosa Cossette D&#39;Elise, a princess and heir to the throne of Erusea, also plays a major role in the plot.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Trigger&#39;s fighter plane, F-22A Raptor, and completes various missions against enemy fighter jets. Other types of aircraft do not appear in this game, unlike in the previous games. The game reintroduces some of the mechanics from the previous installments, such as checkpoints and player-controlled flares. Skies Unknown is also the first game in the series to make clouds influence the gameplay.</p>"

The game&#39;s core feature is the variety of moral decision \u2014 the player decides who is worthy of sacrificing for the sake of the group&#39;s survival.<br />\nThe gameplay features walking and talking with the other characters \u2014 six in total \u2014 while a heavy accent is made on time- and resource management. The game&#39;s name derives from the absence of right and wrong decisions: not only the survival of the team is a task at hand but the survival of an outside world from genocide.</p>"

The player has to go through more than 14 story missions, which include raids on enemies position, escort cargo, and massive space battles.

Ammunition causes more damage, resistance to poisons appears, there are clues about invisible monsters. Yes, it is useful for surviving earthlings - it&#39;s difficult to fight off monsters. Because they are everywhere and quite reasonable. This planet belongs to them already. Hundreds times increased insects and reptiloids, abundantly armed and perceiving people either as a forage, or as intruders. From mission to mission, heroes make their way through mountains of corpses, crowds of furious beasts and through territories that have become empty under the onslaught of aliens. And this constant tension is periodically replaced by exclamations of heroes: life is beautiful!</p>"

        "description": "<p>Anomaly 2 is a sequel to Anomaly: Warzone Earth and the third part in the Anomaly mobile game series. Anomaly series inverted the classic tower defense genre to create an innovative &quot;tower offense&quot; type of strategy.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game is set in the post-apocalyptic near future, sometime after the alien invasion of Earth that was described in Anomaly: Warzone Earth. By 2034, our planet is devastated and mostly covered with ice. The last remnants of humanity are trying to defeat the invading alien machines, who stay besieged in their highly fortified bases.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Like its predecessors, Anomaly 2 puts the player in control of a convoy of armored vehicles. The goal of each mission is to fight your way through the enemy territory that is protected with defense towers and units. The game has no construction options or resource mining, but there are repair zones on each level. They allow the player to upgrade, purchase, or sell his or her units right in the middle of a mission. Anomaly 2 introduces a new gameplay option: morphing. All vehicles have more than one shape and can morph into different units with unique abilities.</p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>Anomaly 2 is the first game in the series to introduce multiplayer. This mode allows playing as either humans or alien machines. Humans gameplay is the same as in single mode. Playing for the alien side, however, completely changes the game and turns it into the tower defense where the player&#39;s goal is to withstand the siege.</p>"

        "description": "<p>ArcaniA is set in the world of Gothic game series and was originally announced as Gothic 4. It was eventually released as a standalone spin-off game with only minor connections to the main plot of Gothic.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Rhobar III, the king of Myrtana and the former protagonist of the Gothic trilogy, sent his army to conquer the Southern Islands. It seems that the king is possessed by an evil force. The protagonist is a young man from the island of Feshyr. As he prepares to marry, Rhobar&#39;s army invades the island, killing the protagonist&#39;s family. Now he&#39;s to become the new Nameless Hero like Rhobar once was. His goal is to avenge his family and to save the world from the madness of the king. </p>\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n<p>The game is set in a high fantasy universe. The world is open, however, it is divided into several regions, each of them serving as an open world in itself. To unlock a new region, the protagonist has to complete certain quests for NPCs that unlock new regions. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Despite not being the proper part of Gothic series, the game shows a strong similarity to the original trilogy. It is a 3D third-person RPG with a strong emphasis on action. Some of the game&#39;s mechanics became simpler. The creators scrapped most spells from the previous games, leaving only three (fire, ice, and lightning), although they can be upgraded. There are three character classes: Warrior, Mage, or Ranger. The protagonist levels up automatically, but to distribute his XP to certain skill is up to the player. Unlike the rest of Gothic games, ArcaniA doesn&#39;t use sleep to skip time and restore health.</p>"

At the end of each level, the players fight with a boss - a unique and buffed up enemy.</p>\n<p>The game&#39;s art style is heavily inspired by the German bunkers of that era. Wolfenstein 3D is one of the first games to use 2.5-dimensional graphics to immerse the players.</p>\n<p>The players are opposed by the SS soldiers, mutants, and guard dogs, which will attack the player only if they get in their line of sight. Several types of enemies can also react to the sounds of gunfire. It is possible to use stealth.</p>\n<p>On their way, the players can find ammunition and weaponry, which are either placed on the floor or are taken away from the enemy corpses. The game features 4 weapons: a knife, a pistol, an MP40 SMG and a multi-barrel MG.</p>"

It takes place in the Lego universe, where the evil Lord Business finds a weapon of mass destruction called &quot;Kragle&quot;. It is prophesied, that a Special One will come with the Piece of Resistance. Eight years later, Emmet Brickowski wakes up in his flat. On his job, he falls down a hole and finds the Piece, upon which he gets grabbed by Wyldstyle.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Like in previous Lego games by TT Fusion, the players control a vast cast of characters from The LEGO Movie. The players traverse the levels that are completely made up from Lego bricks, completing different objectives. </p>\n<p>There are two types of characters present in the game: Regular Builders and Master Builders. The main difference is that the Regular Builders are unable to build objects without the needed instructional pages, while the Master Builders can build any object at any time. All the objects built by the players resemble the items from the real-life Lego sets. </p>\n<p>90 characters are present in the game. The game features the original Lego characters such as Wyldstyle or Lord Business, as well as the ones present in the real-life Lego building sets, such as Batman, Wonder Woman, Gandalf, and many more.</p>"

        "description": "Xenonauts is a strategy game in which you control a multi-national military organisation defending a Cold War-era Earth from alien invasion, using small squads of persistent soldiers to eliminate the extraterrestrials and recover their technology in turn-based ground combat. A detailed strategic layer allows you to co-ordinate the defence of the planet, using your interceptors to shoot down UFOs and researching captured artefacts to learn about your foes and unlock new combat equipment to use on your missions.<br/><br/>Xenonauts is a spiritual successor to the classic X-Com strategy games from the 1990s. We aim to improve the graphics, add new content and streamline the interface whilst still retaining all of the key mechanics of the original games. Devoted fans should love this game, but we're also keen to introduce the joys of old-school grand strategy to a whole new generation of players who might not otherwise experience it!<br/><br/>Please note that the native Mac / Linux versions of the game are still in beta, however older WINE-wrapped \"ports\" are available and known to be stable whilst development of the native ports is still ongoing.Key Features<br/><ul><li> Ground Combat: Xenonauts delivers tense turn-based combat across realistic, varied and fully-destructible battlefields, against almost fifty different variants of enemy. Missions range from capturing crashed UFOs or alien bases to defending cities (or even Xenonaut facilities) against alien attack. You'll experience the chill of encountering a new alien for the first time and the joys of test-firing a new weapon for the first time. Deeply asymmetric combat keeps the battles interesting - after all, you're fighting intergalactic invaders with 1970's ballistic technology!</li></ul><ul><li> Strategic Management: You will also be managing the defence of the planet, dealing with the invading alien UFOs with your customisable interceptors. You need to balance the needs of your funding nations with your own. Your funds are limited - are you going to spend them on battlefield equipment, more scientists, or expanding your coverage of the planet? Your priorities must be balanced carefully if you are to win the war.</li></ul><ul><li> Research Tree: Xenonauts has an extensive research tree with almost a hundred projects to unlock, each with its own unique description and painted artwork. It slowly reveals the intentions and origins of the invaders, while also unlocking new battlefield equipment, aircraft and vehicles for you to use as you harness alien technology and turn it against them. </li></ul><ul><li> Persistent Soldiers: Soldiers in Xenonauts are persistent from mission to mission, improving their stats and gaining ranks with combat experience - but their deaths are always only a single bad move away. You will grow to care about the brave men and women under your command as they slowly grow from green rookies into hardened veterans, but that only makes it more painful when their heroic tale is cruelly cut short by a burst of plasma fire...</li></ul><ul><li> Detailed, Emergent Simulation: Xenonauts contains no scripted missions, just broad rules setting the pace of the invasion. As such, no game plays out the same twice. If you shoot a Scout UFO down over a polar area, you get a Crash Site mission where you can capture a crashed Scout UFO in an Arctic tileset. Commence a battle at night and you'll be fighting the mission in the darkness with reduced sight range. If your base is attacked, you fight the defence in a perfect replica of your base. A lot of time has gone into weaving the two very different halves of the game together into something that feels both natural and enjoyable.</li></ul>"

Another sphere of your interest is the city: you need to find allies and strengthen your authority among people.

The players are free to explore the open world or just complete the missions. There are several game modes in Crash Time 2: a plain race, a pursuit, escort, shadowing, and navigation. The game&#39;s story is divided into 5 distinct cases with 10 missions to complete in each. The game features three difficulty modes which affect the amount of damage that can be taken by the player&#39;s vehicle. </p>\n<p>The developers put a heavy emphasis on the vehicle damage model and slow-motion effects that are present in the game. An overhead map was featured in the game for the first time in the series.</p>\n<p>Before the release of the game, developers advertised a feature where the players can drive out to a plain field and run into cows, which will plow into T-Bone steaks in a cartoony fashion.</p>"

As preparation for an impending Ice Age, a new project, half science experiment half live-entertainment, is launched. It&#39;s called &quot;Darwin Project&quot; and it challenges 10 participants to survive the cold and fight to the death in a treacherous arena.<br />\nKEY FEATURES:<br />\n- MANHUNT &amp; SURVIVAL:<br />\nTrack the position of enemies, by using environmental clues they left behind and be creative with your use of crafted traps to take the upperhand. The biting cold of the Northern Canadian Rockies will also slowly freeze you should you be careless.<br />\nWatch our Dev Diary #1: The Manhunt  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMsJSzGhQds<br />\n- SHOW DIRECTOR:<br />\nThe Show Director is the living bridge between the players and spectators. He/She is the host and master who controls the arena with nuclear bombs, zone closures, gravity storms, and the power of their voice. This could be a real tool of self discovery; the start of your new career as a charming but deadly game show host.<br />\n- LIVE SPECTATOR INTERACTIONS:<br />\nStream viewers on Mixer<em> can also bet live on the competitors they think will reign supreme, in addition to helping the Show Director choose targets for their arena-shaping powers. Whether they\u2019re voting on which player deserves a death-defying heal or which zone to nuke, it\u2019s time for spectators to become active participants in the manhunt!<br />\nTo try out this feature, Darwin Project devs will be hosting matches on https://mixer.com/DarwinProject as Show Directors during the entire duration of the Open beta weekend (from 4pm to 7pm (EST)).<br />\nConsult our Mixer broadcast schedule http://www.scavengers.ca/live-spectator-interactions-broadcast-schedule-mixer/.<br />\n</em>Twitch integration in on its way, stay tuned!</p>"

After the last game of the series was published in 1996, reimagining the established format as a first-person shooter, the game was brought back to its roots, returning not only with the improved graphics, engine, and design but with the classic top-down shoot \u2018em up genre. Theodore J. Conrad is a space engineer that has to restore the engines after the collision with a mysterious empty ship.<br />\nAlien Breed: Impact is an updated version of Alien Breed: Evolution that adds not only new designs for the enemy aliens but an entirely new upgrade shop. It has two full story campaigns for both single player and multiplayer. In the multiplayer cooperative campaign, two players are taking the roles of two other survivors, Thadeus and Eddie, that are trying to find Conrad and assist him on his mission.</p>"

The story follows The Player, a criminal who works for a crime syndicate. One day he steals a time-traveling telephone booth that sends him several decades into the future. Shortly after his time-machine breaks and now with the help of Doc Choc, a time-traveler and Emmett Brown parody, he seeks for the parts to repair the booth.  <br />\nThe gameplay can be described as if original GTA was ported onto the 16-bit console. It mostly has a top-down perspective with several 2D side-scrolling transitions. The game is set in the big open city which player can freely explore. The game has many story missions, side missions and challenges. Like in GTA games, violent actions made by the player can attract police that would try to neutralize him. The wide a range of weapons and tools can be acquired in shops, as rewards or from enemies.  <br />\nThe DX version was initially released for Nintendo 3DS via eShop. This version rebalanced weapons, has several gameplay tweaks and features the \u201cprototype\u201d version of the game which was first made as NES ROM.</p>"

The player has access to different weapons such as a chainsaw, pistol, shotgun, and rocket launcher. There are many types of enemies in the game that vary in size, attacks, speed, amount of health from zombies and imps to huge cyberdemons and skeletons with rocket launchers on their shoulders. Aside from weapons, the player can use different weapons scattered throughout the map. Some of them replenish your health, ammo, and armor, and the other gives you temporary bonuses like increased damage, short-time invincibility acid resistance or invisibility. The levels are filled with secret rooms. Finding them is entirely optional but can significantly help by giving you new weapons early or providing with items and ammunition.  </p>\n<h3>Final DOOM differences</h3>\n<p>Final DOOM is essentially a collection of new maps divided into two packs: TNT: Evilution and The Plutonia Experiment. Different level designers outside ID Software created each pack. The game is noticeable for its hard difficulty that surpasses the level of two previous games.</p>"

The plot of the game has nothing to do with the previous parts. The story tells of a new team that was relocated to Las Vegas to defeat international terrorist grouping led by Irena Morales, which attacks different parts of the city.</p>\n<p>There were specific changes in the gameplay: now the player does not have a standard health meter, to restore strength you need to catch your breath in cover. A third-person camera was added, it is involved in shooting from the shelter. The game uses a checkpoint system, and there are almost no cutscenes. The whole story is told with the help of the display on the helmet of the operative.</p>\n<p>To complete the story missions, the player needs to plan the attack on the Rainbow Six and help with its execution. Resist the attack will be wiser than in the past parts of the AI. In addition to the story campaign, multiplayer is available.</p>"

It is a science fiction game in which the protagonist can use his robotic arm for various purposes.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game directly continues the plot of the original 1988 NES game. It is set in the near future, ten years after the first Bionic Commando. The protagonist of the previous part, Nathan &quot;R.A.D.&quot; Spencer, a &quot;bionic&quot; cyborg soldier, makes a return. He is voiced by Mike Patton, the vocalist of Faith No More.</p>\n<p>Despite his heroic deeds, Spencer was framed for crimes he was not guilty of and sentenced to be executed. The government releases the protagonist after a terrorist attack that destroys the whole Ascension City. Spencer has to clear his name and earn his freedom by finding and defeating the perpetrators of the attack, the BioReign organization.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Nathan from the third person view. Unlike the original Bionic Commando, the sequel is in 3D. The level design allows the player to fully explore all three dimensions as it includes skyscrapers the protagonist has to climb. </p>\n<p>The most definitive part of the Bionic Commando gameplay is Spencer&#39;s retractable bionic arm. The limb increases his reach and strength, allowing the protagonist to swing across the gaps and canyons and throw heavy objects and enemies. The player can also use two types of guns: the Tungsten gun for weak rapid fire and the Prototype gun for powerful single shots.</p>"

The players create their own character and customize it before being put in a procedurally generated world. The game teaches the players to interact with this world and gives the first tools and tips to do so. </p>\n<p>Creativerse improves upon Minecraft&#39;s multiplayer modes, as the players do not have to install server-side mods to activate the possibilities of claiming land and the protection of player-created buildings.</p>\n<p>The player progression in Creativerse is made through the recipe system that expands as the players discover more and more crafting recipes. The game&#39;s crafting system heavily resembles the same of Minecraft, as the players find resources in the generated world&#39;s biomes. These materials are later used to create new items that can also be used to later build more sophisticated tools and weapons. Several very rare recipes can be obtained through combat or dungeon exploration.</p>\n<h3>Paid version features</h3>\n<p>The paid version of the game allows creating as many worlds as the players like, grants 20 more inventory slots and new items, such as a flashlight.</p>"

After pressing spacebar, the model starts moving according to the player\u2019s command for several frames and then the next turn begins. The goal of each match is either to gain more points than your opponent or to knock them outside the ring. Players earn points by successfully performing different punches, kicks, grabs and other moves. <br />\nToribash multiplayer offers many different game modes. They vary depending on how many frames one turn takes, the distance between characters or specific aspects of in-game physics.

He is not interested in saving the world, but when it comes to getting a reward, or his own head is on the line \u2013 he\u2019ll gladly jump into the action. And when the cult members recruited him to save the Caleigh, a beautiful princess, he considers that it might be worth his time.<br />\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale (2004) was a deviation from the main series, not only with a 3D environments but a moral choice system. The Bard has a choice in almost every dialogue to give either snarky or nice response, which might have lasting consequences through the entirety of the game. The game introduces summoning mechanic, which is improved with every musical instrument Bard finds during the story that allows players to call for the help of a companion. Companion specialty varied and they might be attacking defensive or utility. And because the game is focused on a musician, the player will view many musical numbers and songs.</p>"

Their content depends on the type of sleeping pills that the hero takes. Hallucinations can visit the hero regardless of sleep and cheerfulness.

Run the sheriff\u2019s department, manage your cops, investigate, interrogate, and incarcerate. Make tough decisions \u2013 and try to keep out of prison yourself! \u2013 in this story-driven mixture of adventure, strategy, and turn-based tactical combat.<br />\nIs it a simulation? A management game? A tactical challenge? A visual novel? A puzzle? It\u2019s all of these, and more!Dive into one-of-a-kind -story driven experience.Welcome to Sharpwood, a cold and harsh border town riven with violence, where no one is completely innocent. Smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. To maintain peace and order, the young sheriff Lilly Reed (Sarah Hamilton, The Longest Journey) will have to team up with fugitive criminal Jack Boyd (Jon St. John, Duke Nukem), and pray that her dangerous plan doesn\u2019t spiral out of control.<br />\nTake charge of the Sheriff\u2019s department.Your subordinates aren\u2019t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices \u2013 and you&#39;ll have to reckon with all of them in order to survive. Is one of your guys drinking too much alcohol? Or always coming up with excuses for not coming to work? Or does he refuse to follow orders? You\u2019ll have to show a steady hand if you want to impose discipline on this department.<br />\nEngage in tactical combat.During your most dangerous operations, the game will switch to turn-based combat. Gather a team of your finest cops (or use your drunk and stupid bums \u2013 you don\u2019t always have the luxury of being choosy!). Carefully study the terrain, adapt your plans, stealthily approach your suspects and use non-lethal weapons and equipment \u2013 if the situation allows. True, sometimes gunfights are almost impossible to avoid, but be careful: This Is the Police 2 doesn\u2019t have hit points. A single bullet can cost a cop their life.<br />\nBecome a true detective.Collect evidence, study case materials, interrogate suspects (or use more... forceful methods) and send the criminals to court. And if the suspect was innocent? Perhaps it&#39;s time to find out if any Sharpwood judges can be bought.</p>"

It was developed by ACE Team.</p>\n<p>The game is loosely based on the myth of Sisyphus. The main objective of the player is to use a giant boulder in order to destroy the enemy castle located at the bottom of the hill while at the same time defending your own stronghold using various structures. Players can build money farms to raise the funds necessary to build defensive structures or upgrade the boulder itself. After gathering a certain amount of money it is possible to equip both defensive and offensive upgrades to the boulder. The enemies can destroy the boulder in which case the player has to wait until the boulder spawns again and proceed with the offense. The player wins if they successfully destroy the enemy&#39;s castle gates and place the boulder right in the center of the castle. </p>\n<p>There are five distinctive time periods present in the game, such as romanticism, rococo, renaissance, and so on.</p>"

The series is often compared with the universe of Heroes of Might and Magic, but the gameplay and other differences (for example, the lack of a turn-based movement around the game world). But games have one publisher - New World Computing.</p>\n<h3>The Russian way</h3>\n<p>In March 2007, the Russian company 1C bought the rights to use the trademark and game universe of King&#39;s Bounty. The development was entrusted to the Vladivostok studio Katauri Interactive, which are known for the series of games Space Rangers. The game takes place in the fictional world of Endoria. In 2009, there was an add-on for the main game under the name of Armored Princess, and apparently, because of the love of Russian to matryoshka, the company decided to release another add-on to the add-on of the original game.</p>\n<h3>The plot</h3>\n<p>The action of Crossworlds takes place in the world of Teana. The player takes control of Princess Amelie, as in the previous game, and guides her through two independent story campaigns. One of them is \u201cOrcs on the March\u201d - the remastered version of the campaign from the previous part, and two other absolutely new stories in the virtual universe. In addition to developer\u2019s created campaigns, players are able to create their own adventures in the built-in editor. The play is possible only in a single mode, and multiplayer is not available in the game.</p>"

It serves as a prequel to Uncharted 3: Drake&#39;s Deception. The player controls the series\u2019 main protagonist, the adventurer Nathan Drake. In Golden Abyss, Drake arrives at an archeological dig site in Panama alongside fellow treasure hunters Marisa Chase and Jason Dante. Before they investigate the artifacts they found, Dante betrays his partners to a mercenary leader Roberto Guerro. The villains believe that the findings can lead to Quivira, a secret city of gold. Nathan and Marisa have to escape captivity and save the artifacts from the enemy.<br />\nGolden Abyss became the first Uncharted game released for a portable console, PS Vita, and it uses the console\u2019s touch screen as part of the controls. Otherwise, the gameplay didn\u2019t change much since the original Uncharted. It combines intricate platforming and acrobatics with the elements of a third-person shooter and puzzle-solving. One of the few features the game introduces is that Drake can use his journal and photo camera to search for clues to the puzzles and identify locations. Golden Abyss has no multiplayer options.</p>"

Overcast tells a story of an old hunter, living in complete solitude in the forest near the remote village. But players will have to deal with the fact, that now there\u2019s a dangerous creature, that\u2019s been haunting every human around, killing every resident of the village and now it\u2019s the hunter\u2019s turn.<br />\nThe game offers similar mechanics to the source of main inspiration \u2013 Amnesia. Players will have to carry a lantern and hunt down several monsters in each of a few in-game chapters. Unlike Amnesia, Overcast has gunplay, map system, and scarce checkpoints, adding the high risk of replaying the chapter from the beginning, if players lost focus and made a mistake of dying too close, to the end of the chapter. The original game soundtrack is using guitar compositions to set the tone and ease the tension after the horror scenes or jump-scares. There are three distinct monster types, and each of them introduced from a first-person perspective of the said monster, adding to the tension. The game gained a surge of popularity, due to the game being played and recommended by several big YouTubers.</p>"

The game consists of matches: two 15-layers teams try to destroy the opponent\u2019s castle and protect their own.</p>\n<p>In Happy Wars you can choose between three types of characters: the warrior, the mage, and the cleric. They also have subclasses that define their specification. For example, Berserker is stronger than an ordinary warrior and more suitable for protecting lines. In general, every class has their unique abilities that can be upgraded with the in-game currency and real money. Wisely balanced teams have more chances to win battles.</p>\n<p>The key feature that differs Happy Wars from other MOBA-type games is that before you destroy your opponent\u2019s base you need to build yours. Bases are equipped with multiple weapons so it\u2019s hard to get close to the enemy rift. Besides the center, there are several control points; the most massive battles are usually held near them. However, the cartoonish style of the visuals makes such epic fights look funny, explaining the name of the game.</p>"

The game follows a player made character that joins Fenrir, an organization that aims to exterminate Aragami using God Arcs, the weapon made from Aragami\u2019s cells.  </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game consists of more than 100 missions that can be played both cooperatively or competitively. The goal of each mission is to slay specific enemies with the time limit.<br />\nThe God Arc is the only weapon available to the player. However, it can transform into three different forms: blade, gun, and shield. The character has various moves such as dashing, jumping, sprinting as well as several types of attack. These moves and using God Arc in blade form consumes player\u2019s stamina. Using gun mode, on the other hand, consumes Oracle Points that can be replenished by attacking enemies in blade mode. </p>\n<h3>Resurrection version</h3>\n<p>The remaster of the game named God Eater Resurrection was released 2016 for PS4, PS Vita and Windows.

Each map is a racing track in an utterly non-racing environment, such as a kitchen table, children\u2019s playroom and so on. Different race types make the player consider his car of choice, as well as the upgrades, for the challengers are vicious and always tries to utilize every card in their sleeve against you.<br />\nThe game also features a multiplayer mode, where up to 8 racers can compete with each other on various race tracks, for glory or fun. The soundtrack and the graphics style gives the game the look of a real racing simulator while keeping the setting of toy cars, which allows the players to immerse themselves in the high octane world of Table Top Racing.</p>"

The action starts from an uninhabited island called Katorga-12.<br />\nAn electromagnetic surge from the island hits an American satellite, and the unit goes there to investigate the place. Another surge damages the crew\u2019s helicopter; Nathaniel is the only person who stays alive. He fades out to find himself in the past. At this point, the plot twists; every event in the past has an impact on the present. Back in 1955, Nathaniel meets Nikolai Demichev, a Soviet scientist working at Katorga-12. Further on, Renko and Demichev run against each other during the whole story; their interactions are at the core of the game. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Singularity is the first-person shooter; the player performs the protagonist&#39;s actions. The main gameplay device is not a weapon, but an artifact called the Time Manipulation Device. Using that, the player can move the protagonists and objects around back and forth in time. At some point the player has to make choices; they affect the game result. The game also has multiplayer modes; the player can perform either as a soldier or as a creature, one of the individuals inhabiting Katorga-12. </p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The game\u2019s concept is based on the Cold War era. Some features are inspired by exploration of military bases back in the 20th century and by sci-fi movies.</p>"

The plane&#39;s main weapon can shoot only in the direction of flying so the players need some skill shooting and flying at the same time. Further into the game upgrades for the plane are unlocked, such as new weapons, body kits, and engines. There is 125 plane builds available in the game. The build the player uses affects the music player in the game. Every plane subsystem brings something new into the game&#39;s music. </p>\n<p>The main objective of the player is to survive against the enemies overwhelming force, which includes reactive and experimental planes, zeppelins, boats, ships, subs and so on. A scoring system is also present in the game. Upon the enemies destruction, the player gains a score multiplier.</p>"

The combat gameplay has truly evolved since the days of Momo III, and the character sprites are now bigger and better animated.<br />\nWe also made an effort to include more tiny details here and there, expand on the world lore, and create more exciting boss battles.<br />\nI believe this is the best Momodora game in the series, and definitely the most polished title so far.<br />\nMost of us at Playism grew up playing video games during the early days of the NES, and throughout the years, action-platformers have been some of the staples in our respective game libraries. Long before \u201cMetroidvania\u201d was a thing, we fell in love with the original Castlevania series, as well as with other Hall of Famers such as the Metroid, Contra, and Ninja Gaiden games. About halfway through the lifecycle of the first-generation PlayStation, sprite-based game development took an unfortunate nosedive, and the sorts of games we loved most and grew up with just weren&#39;t being made as frequently or, frankly, with as much love and care as they once were.<br />\nIndie game development really helped to reinvigorate both the sprite-based action-platformer genre and the magic of actual sprite animation. rdein&#39;s games combine what we\u2019ve always loved about tight-action 2D gaming with splendid influences from more modern games like Dark Souls. The dedication to your actions necessitated by animation locks; the insane intensity driving the boss fights and how epic it is that this quaint little heroine can tackle these heroic endeavors; the attention to detail in the environments, designs, and animations... all of this stuff is simply stunning and rdein pulls it off to beautiful effect.<br />\nThen there\u2019s also the story itself, which is also a masterpiece in game storytelling: a strange, mysterious world that you inhabit with countless hopeless souls whom you are trying to save. There is painstaking detail in every item, every snippet of dialogue. You find yourself constantly readjusting how you feel about these people. You&#39;re trying to save them, but do they even want to be saved? Or should you be more worried about that awkwardly sinister tone in their voices...?<br />\nMomodora: RUTM shouldn\u2019t exactly be categorized as \u201cMetroidvania\u201d or \u201cSouls-like\u201d, but there certainly are elements of both contained within. It&#39;s a game of its own, and it\u2019s one of the best entries in the mind-bogglingly expansive genre of side-scrolling action-platformers. We at Playism all love the game, and we can state with absolute confidence that if you\u2019ve bothered to read this far, then you certainly will, too.</p>"

The story of the game focuses on the tale of a dead general, once destined to become the new Shogun but viciously interrupted by a stealthy foe. As he meets his demise, man learns that while not exactly he is capable of returning to life, but instead, he can set out on the way to becoming the new Shogun of the Dead.<br />\nThe game features a set of missions, where the player has to control a small army and defeat their enemy, sometimes far outnumbering. Various tactics can be employed to achieve victory, and the clever use of each unit and their abilities often leads to a swift and fruitful conquest. Each map can be replayed, as different outcomes under different circumstances give new bonuses for the further playthrough.<br />\nThe graphics of the game are hand-drawn, styled like a comic book, where every character looks formidable, but at the same time, hilarious. The strange humor of the game includes several gags about the Japanese culture, history, and mythology, and the dialogues between the characters do not leave any player dissatisfied.</p>"

Major Earth corporations ventured to space in order to prevent the decay of civilization, and the player takes command over the elite force to fight the aliens directly in space. Interceptor primarily is a space combat simulator. But the commander is still in charge of the region, so it would be players\u2019 responsibility to manage bases, resources, and finances. <br />\nThe game main screen is no longer shows the anthill of interconnected rooms of the X-COM headquarters. Now players see the map of the space section. Over the course of the first several missions, a new commander will be taught how to locate, intercept and destroy enemy ships. Every battle is played out as a flight simulator. Commander can purchase equipment, hire pilots and research technologies. It\u2019s the first X-COM game to include multiplayer, where players participate in the space combat.</p>"

        "description": "<p>This science-fiction game begins where most of the science fiction games end. Earthlings survived the invasion of hostile aliens - and were able to repel him. The battles were not even on the planet Earth itself, but at the space station. And at this station there were many traces of carnage. From blood to parts of aliens, from holes in the walls from bullets and shells to broken glass. And now all this must be cleaned, collected, and the garbage must be thrown away. A game about space janitors, and an extraordinary task for them.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>In the course of the game, it is necessary to solve the tasks related to cleaning up of the huge space station, which survived the battle between the inhabitants of the Earth and the alien invaders, from the dirt and debris. It is necessary to remove the most diverse and exotic garbage: remains of bodies of aliens and earthlings, shot casings and broken glass, medicines for the wounded, weapons and who knows what else. It is necessary to wash the floors and walls of blood and soot, to seal holes from bullets in walls, ceilings and floors.</p>\n<p>As tools, players have a mop to wash out stains, a special device for detecting biological remains, and a PDA. You can interact with garbage and simply with the help of hands.</p>\n<p>At each level there are devices for cleaning and recycling garbage: an incineration plant, a source of clean water, a container in which smaller debris is placed, such as cans, liners and body parts, a welding device for repairing holes in walls, and a vending machine where the player can get lights, medicines, a &quot;wet floor&quot; sign, other signs and lamps. Sometimes these devices work incorrectly and produce even more pollution.</p>\n<p>The player can figure out how to use improvised tools to speed up and simplify cleaning. On the other hand, the player should think about how his actions will affect the situation and will not lead to even more pollution and the need to clean the same place several times.</p>\n<p>After passing each level, the player enters the so-called &quot;The Office&quot;. This is the place where the work done at this level is summed up. The player sees what he missed to draw conclusions for the future. In this place you can also get things as a reward for the work done.</p>\n<p>The cleaning takes up any amount of time, but there are penalties for poorly executed work. If less than 75% of the territory is taken away, the player can be fired and he will lose all the accumulated achievements.</p>\n<h3>Additions.</h3>\n<p>There are several additions to the game. The gameplay in these additions is the same as in the main game, but setting is different.</p>\n<p>Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is set in the first chapter of the Flying Wild Hog&#39;s Shadow Warrior, cleaning up the mess.</p>\n<p>Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa&#39;s Rampage - the action takes place on the North Pole, and you have to clean up behind the crazy Santa Claus, in his workshop.</p>\n<p>A Halloween DLC pack entitled Viscera Cleanup Detail: House of Horror, featuring a crime scene of a house, where an unsolved mass murder has happened, while the player gets to uncover it during the gameplay.</p>"

You will fight as a crew of up to 16 real players on a ship led by another player that has been voted as captain. Modes can have up to 54 players in a battle!Coordinate and cooperate to be efficient and be a devastating crew<br />\nIf you&#39;re part of the crew, you may help the ship in any way you see fit without being forced to a role. You can be the part of the gunnery crew by loading cannons and firing at the enemy, or be the master of repairs and help keep the ship afloat by patching holes in the ship, repairing sails, or pumping out water. Help keep your ship&#39;s fire power up by running supplies for your fellow crewman, or even board an enemy ship and conquer it!Lead your crew as the Captain and dominate the opponent or defeat an arch nemesis<br />\nIssue commands to your crew, keep the coordination flowing as to which side to be at the ready, focusing on repairs or boarding the enemy! You can order which sides of the ship you want loaded with what, and motivate them until victory or death. Captain nominations occur at the start of the round and captain ratings improve or worsen depending on your success or failure.Game modes with variation<br />\nRanging from a traditional duel style 1v1 ship deathmatch all the way to a 3v3 deathmatch of various ship sizes, you will be tested as a captain, your coordination with other captains, and as a crew. Weather will change with each round, spanning from a calm day with islands to a heavy storm in the open ocean. More game modes are planned to come in free content updates to make sure things stay interesting!Communication is key<br />\nThere are multiple voice chat channels to keep coordinated, global, crew, faction, and proximity. Tell the powder monkey next to you, to fill yer&#39; crate or the friendly ship&#39;s captain to come to your aid. Aside from voice channels there are also crew commands that are extremely helpful to people without microphones. You can expect the crew with the best communication and cooperation to win!Customization as both player and yer Ship<br />\nName your ship, change its colors and make it known in tales told. Change your appearance and outfits to display your skill, time played and persistence as a fellow crewman.Developers that are passionate about feedback and are part of the community<br />\nSince our early development and Kickstarter we&#39;ve spoken to our players through both discord and in-game chat, taking suggestions and feedback with care in real time. Every suggestion made by our players is truly considered and discussed, and we&#39;ve been careful to keep in line with the vision we set out to create for Blackwake. The result is a game that we all helped create together and can enjoy together.As long as Blackwake breathes we&#39;ll keep her fed with content<br />\nWe want to keep developing Blackwake with FREE additional content to make Blackwake the best possible game it can be. No paid DLC to divide the community or pay to win items to give players who spend more an advantage. We have many more ideas for Blackwake, and we&#39;re excited to use them to keep the game fresh and active.</p>"

The ability to open tears to another dimension is like this a particular kind of representing escapism. <br />\nThe game features platforming sections, and the ability to turn the real world into the magical one is introduced: tools brought out from the latter may aid the protagonist in their quest. The whole magical setting is very much like going into another dimension for the stuff needed. The Monster is also a crucial part of the gameplay \u2014 he helps Quico to hop around the gaps.

        "description": "<p>12 is Better Than 6 is a top-down shooter with stealth elements based on the Wild West theme. </p>\n<h3>Plot and art style</h3>\n<p>The game takes place in 1873 Texas. The story follows a Mexican runaway that does not remember anything about his past other than there is a bounty on his head. The game is notable for its art style that imitates pictures drawn with pen and paper. The game\u2019s visuals are stylized, but the story bluntly describes the brutal nature of the late 1800s. The character himself is not a hero in the typical sense of the word, and some of the protagonist\u2019s actions throughout the game are going to be far from honorable. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay is a top-down twin-stick shooter and shares some similarities with famed Hotline Miami series. The campaign consists of four acts that feature numerous missions centered on killing enemies as effectively as possible. One of the most notable characteristics of the gameplay is that you have to cock and reload your guns, using different buttons manually. The hero\u2019s weaponry consists of iconic Wild West firearms such as revolvers, double-barreled shotguns, rifles, and bows. Between missions, you come across hub towns in which you can restock ammo, buy upgrades or take side-quests to earn more money. <br />\nBesides the primary campaign, there is an arena mode that makes you fight waves of enemies.</p>"

It is dominated by the ruins and technologies of an ancient civilization, the Precursors. This civilization also created eco, a type of energy that comes in different colors and can be used to various effects. There\u2019s the dark eco that can distort life, and its Dark Sage, Gol Acheron, is going to unleash it on the world. He sent his servants, the Lurkers, to gather eco for him.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The player assumes the role of Jak, a mute yet troublemaking teenage boy. His best friend is a boy called Daxter. When the two explored the forbidden ruins, the Lurkers attacked them. Daxter came under the influence of dark eco and mutated into a mixture of otter and weasel he calls \u201cottsel.\u201d He can still talk, however, and will comment on Jak\u2019s actions throughout the game. Jak learns that only Gol Acheron can bring Daxter back to normal. The boy, accompanied by Daxter on his shoulder, sets out on a dangerous journey to save his friend and the world.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Much of the gameplay is centered around collecting items and resources. On each level, Jak has to obtain power cells to activate Precursors\u2019 machines and advance to the next area. Other collectibles, such as eco particles, improve the protagonist\u2019s attacks, health, or speed. Jak\u2019s attacks are mostly hand-to-hand, but yellow eco allows him to shoot bolts.</p>"

This multiplayer-oriented game unites players in teams of up to five to battle against each other on an arena, or to fight an AI-controlled team of the same size.<br />\nThe game offers more than 30 playable characters, mostly from The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, including Bilbo, Sauron, Legolas, Gandalf, and Gollum. Their design is based on Peter Jackson&#39;s movie series. There are also several characters that don&#39;t appear directly in movies or books, such as Arathorn, father of Aragorn. All characters are divided into &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; factions to preserve a semblance of continuity behind the battles, so that Kili wouldn&#39;t have to fight Thorin, for example. Treacherous Saruman can join either side.<br />\nThe goal of each team is to destroy the enemy base that is protected not only by the opposing players but also by defense towers. Gameplay in Guardians of Middle-Earth has a distinct &quot;RTS&quot; feel to it. Both teams\u2019 bases regularly spawn \u201cminions\u201d who join players in the fight, making the game more about clashes of armies than duels between individual champions. The RPG element is minimal, and there are no in-game items or upgrades.</p>"

The game is set in the same universe as Surgeon Simulator 2013 and serves as a prequel to it.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>A paranoid therapy patient starts noticing slices of bread or toast moving in his house. He takes it as a warning from an unknown party or as a taunt. The patient later finds out that the only reason behind the slices of bread being moved around is that the bread became sentient. A chain of incidents with the involvement of the bread leads to the Patient, mister Murton, having a heart attack and crashing his car. After the crash, he is taken to a hospital by the Surgeon that is the main character of Surgeon Simulation 2013.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The players control a slice of bread with the objective of making toast. It is essential to keep an eye out on the edibility meter, as the players can encounter environmental hazards, such as fluids, before turning into a toast. Each level of the game represents a different day of the week.</p>\n<p>The game was thoroughly supported with multiple expansion packs. Several new types of bread were added, such as a baguette, a bagel, or a cracker. The type of bread chosen changes the objective the players have to complete. For example, while playing as a baguette, the players have to destroy all the fragile objects they find in the room.</p>\n<p>New levels were also added to the game. One of which is a crossover with Team Fortress 2 and its sandwich item.</p>"

As well as the first game, Van Helsing II is based on different gothic fantasy tales, with elements from Stoker\u2019s Dracula as the main source of influence. However, despite the grim setting, the series offers comic relief elements through dialogues, NPCs and many more references.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Regarding game mechanics, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing follow the steps of the genre\u2019s progenitor, Diablo, with hordes of enemies to combat with, various classes for the main character, large, and different loot. The new elements in the second part of the series are various interactions with the rebels, where the protagonist can train and assemble task teams and send them out on different side quests. </p>\n<h3>Graphical elements and other features</h3>\n<p>The game engine is shared between both installments of the series; however, the second game brings out smoothened textures, corners, and almost every detail, making slight improvements while staying true to the steampunk setting and overall tone. The game also offers a cooperative multiplayer campaign, and a competitive multiplayer mode, where up to 8 players can engage in PvP battles.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Quake 4 is a first-person shooter developed by Raven Software, the fourth installment in the series and the first Quake game not developed by id Software. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Storywise, Quake 4 is a sequel to Quake 2 and continues the story of the war between humans and cyborg alien race Strogg. You play as a Marine Corporal Matthew Kane, a member of elite Rhino Squad. The squad participates in the invasion on Strogg&#39;s home planet, but their spacecraft gets crushed in the middle of the battle zone. Now the protagonist must reunite with his team and finish the mission.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay shares many similarities with previous entries in the series, however this time, the game is much more single-player focused. The single-player mostly consists of fighting with aliens in different locations on foot with occasional differences such as turret sections or mech missions. One of the most notable differences in the game comparing to the rest of the series is that most of the time you are accompanied by the squadmates that help you fight enemies. The player has 12 weapons to choose from, most of which are recurring from the previous games such as nailgun, shotgun, railgun, blaster.<br />\nThe multiplayer includes six different game modes: Deathmatch, Tourney, Capture the Flag, Arena Capture the Flag and DeadZone.</p>"

The players are free to choose one of seventeen characters to play as. The game also features a so-called Character Card system which allows for the customization of the chosen character. The players can also mod their weapons however they see fit. </p>\n<h3>Controversy</h3>\n<p>Raiders of the Broken Planet was renamed to Spacelords due to completely changing its pricing model and going free to play. All the campaigns of the game were made available to all the players.</p>\n<p>Yet the gunplay got an overhaul. In order to get a new weapon, the players have to grind for a randomly spawning blueprints and then spend large amounts of in-game currency to build the weapon they got.

Breath of Death VIII is a 2D adventure in the best traditions of role-playing games of the late 80&#39;s, early 90&#39;s from the American studio Zeboyd Games. The studio consists of only two people: Robert Boyd and William Stiernberg. The title is a reference to the number parts of Final Fantasy, in fact, the previous 6 of the Breath of Death parts do not exist.</p>\n<p>The player follows the adventures of Dem the Skeleton Knight, Lita the Vampire Techie and Erik the Zombie Prince. Each can be customized using upgrades from the branching skill-tree.</p>\n<p>The developers wanted to abandon the most annoying element in the classic RPGs - turn-based combat and endless random encounters. Therefore, the game uses a hybrid combo system that takes into account several important parameters: the character is chosen and how many moves have already been made. Also, the number of random enemy-encounters in one location is limited to a certain number.</p>"

The gameplay is no different from the other games of the series: the player still needs to connect the attacks in combos and arrange hack and slash mayhem. This is the only game in the series, in which multiplayer is available for eight people: the main task is to seize control of the card and get a reward from the gods.</p>"

The employer has a lot of money and an unclear motive. The player agrees and, as well as the story goes, it reveals new details about the mysterious customer. Each riddle and each puzzle suggest several possible solutions. This is also facilitated by the physical model of the game. There are two polarities: plus and minus, red and blue. The player can change them to solve puzzles and pass levels. To prevent the player from it, there are dangerous lasers, machine guns, and moving platform.</p>\n<p>Despite the developers&#39; claims of the game\u2019s difficulty, the game will not offer unsolvable tasks, and its completion will take just several evenings.</p>"

Visually it resembles the classic jRPG but plays differently.</p>\n<p>Battles are all also turn-based like in the reference, but by using an object or weapon, the player has to move the main character and hit the enemies, dodging their attacks. As the name implies, the main battles take place after random encounters. The main character can be joined by new characters, at levels you can find new weapons. At the end of each level, the player will face a boss battle. The game quite accurately adheres to the style of the series:  a vast number of enemies appears on the screen simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The game is rather short.

        "description": "<p>In the sci-fi game Offworld Trading Company, the player can lead an interplanetary corporation in a futuristic trade war for control of Mars.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game mixes resource mining and construction used in real-time strategies with a stronger economic element. The player has to choose a company he or she will control. The other three companies become the player&#39;s rivals. They seldom fight outright, and their rivalry is largely economic. However, they can secretly organize acts of sabotage against each other, eliminate resources with underground nukes and hire goons to attack or defend. The main goal of the game is to assume control over all four companies by purchasing their majority stakes and to create a monopoly. If a rival company obtains the majority in the player&#39;s corporation, he or she loses the game.</p>\n<h3>Resources</h3>\n<p>The game puts a strong emphasis on mining and trading resources. Each level starts with the player scanning the surface of Mars to find resources and build his or her headquarters next to them. Offworld Trading Company has thirteen types of resources. Most of the resources, such as iron, aluminum, and water, can be mined from the Martian soil. Some, like steel, food, and chemicals, are produced from other resources and require special buildings. Each resource has a value that can increase or decrease depending on the demand and supply.</p>"

The Survival is classic: stay on the platform using your powers. The Dash mode adds to the concept a necessity to collect orbs on the same collapsing platform.

In this mode, Races, Derbies and Stunts, Deathmatch Derbies, Head-On race mode are available.</p>\n<h3>Who are these guys?</h3>\n<p>If you are alone, eleven other drivers compete with you. Everyone has an individual style of riding, character and temperament - you will not be mistaken, after meeting them on the track. Here are just a few of their CVs.</p>\n<p>Jack Benton prefers cars that can perfectly hit - fast, small, but heavy. His aggression exceeds experience - it makes him even more dangerous.</p>\n<p>Sofia Martinez prefers light cars to drive sharply and drive fast. But she can be seen and on a heavy pick-up truck, by which she tries to split all who can.</p>\n<p>Jason Walker is unpredictable in everything except one - he always chooses muscle-cars. He uses experience to beat his opponent with feeling.</p>\n<p>Katie Jackson is hysterical and aggressive at the same time, she&#39;s not a rival, she&#39;s a moving obstacle.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Cook, Serve, Delicious is a hardcore restaurant sim, one of the few in its genre that gives the players total control over where they want to take their restaurant.</p>\n<p>The game centers on an old, worn down restaurant in the SherriSoda Tower, which was once the heart of the building but closed down as business (and tenants) dropped to an all time low. But with the local economy rising back up and occupancy reaching its maximum, SherriSoda Tower has decided to bring back the old Cook, Serve, Delicious restaurant, and has given you complete control to bring it back to its old five star status of world class dining.</p>\n<p>To do that, you\u2019ll start with a few thousand dollars and thirty foods to choose from to put on your menu, as well as a host of restaurant equipment and more. Nearly everything is unlocked from the start of the game for you to purchase; this is your restaurant, and you must figure out the best strategy to get that restaurant packed with satisfied customers. Can you prove your culinary skills?</p>\n<p>And if that weren\u2019t enough, you\u2019ll also have the opportunity to be cast in the Iron Cook television show, throw parties for offices in SherriSoda Tower, read virtual mail in your SherriSoda Tower Email account which ranges from game tips to crazy spam (nearly 500 emails in all), from customers providing feedback to your restaurant to opportunities such as being able to fund projects via \u201cClicknStart\u201d and other big surprises!</p>\n<p>The game draws a lot of inspiration from the original PlayStation game Ore no Ryouri. Cook, Serve, Delicious! was initially a free game that used hand-drawn graphics in its gameplay. The game&#39;s author David Galindo wanted to make a sequel for that game, but he had no funds to do so. After publishing his first attempt at releasing a full-scale game, Galindo earned some money that would be used for the development of Cook, Serve, Delicious!</p>\n<p>With hours of content and tons of secrets and unlockables, Cook, Serve, Delicious will provide a big challenge for anyone who\u2019s ready to take their crumbling, rat infested eatery to a luxurious Platinum Star Restaurant. Good luck!</p>"

It is the third game in Penumbra series of games.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game picks right off the end of the last one. Phillip sends an e-mail asking his friend to &quot;Kill them. Kill them all.&quot;, after which he takes a hit on the head from someone, knocking him unconscious. The main character sets out to escape from the research complex yet again and stumbles upon the notes of another scientist that was also trapped in the complex.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game features a highly sophisticated physics engine. This allows interacting with in-game items by moving the mouse instead of pointing at clicking at them. The game features no weapons whatsoever and the only option for the players to avoid getting killed is to run away and hide. </p>\n<p>Unlike the previous games, Philip can no longer put items in his inventory, yet he can still move them in the world. There are no clues or the characters thoughts present in the notebook. The players have to find keys to activate a portal that leads the players off the level. These keys are usually placed in hard to get spots and require quite a bit of thinking to get to.</p>\n<p>There are two endings present in the game. The ending is chosen by the players themselves and is not affected by the players&#39; actions made throughout the game.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Skate 3 is a skateboarding simulator developed by EA Black Box. It is the third game in the series and is a direct sequel to Skate 2.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game takes place sometime later after the events of Skate 2. The main protagonist, who is now known as The Legend, became one of the best skaters. He travels to a coastal town of Port Carventer to take part in a sponsored event but fails. To get to the top again, he has to put up his own team.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Port Carventer differs a lot from San Vanselona. There are no zones where skating is restricted. The city itself consists of three zones: The City, The University, and the Industrial Area. Each zone has its own differences, for example, there are a lot of monuments and concrete buildings in The City, while The University boasts a high number of open spaces.</p>\n<p>Like in previous installments, the game&#39;s core mechanic called Flick It is still present in the game and is essential for getting high scores. It gives the player control of the skater and maps it to the right stick of the gamepad. Players are given points for doing tricks. The amount of points depends on the difficulty of the trick and their combos. </p>\n<p>The game offers three difficulty settings: Easy (you can jump higher and do tricks faster), Normal (a classic difficulty, like in previous games of the series), and Hardcore (the physics resembles the same of the real world). </p>\n<p>There is an in-depth tutorial called Skate.school that is accessible at any point in the game.</p>"

        "description": "<p>This is an intense strategy board game in a steampunk world of corrupt capitalist gremlins who compete for money, political power and prestige. Save and invest, steal and extort, arrest and get arrested \u2013 in single-player and multiplayer, with ranks and ladders, team mode and spectator mode. Featuring seasonal content updates, regular tournaments, item drops, full support of Steam Community Market \u2013 and more!</p>\n<p>HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME?<br />\nGremlins, Inc. is designed for up to 6 players, in multiplayer or in single-player mode (with AI bots). Each player has 6 cards on their hand (replenished from the same deck) and uses them either to move around the playing field or to perform different game actions. There is a lot of interaction with other players, and duels are significantly different from 3-player or 4-player games. You can play until a certain score limit, or until agreed number of rounds, or for time limit. The game offers both custom and ranked sessions (with matchmaking by rating).</p>\n<p>CAN YOU PLAY IN TEAMS OR JUST WATCH?<br />\nYes, you can! In addition to custom sessions (where you define the parameters of the session and may optionally set filters for those who can join you) and password-protected private sessions (so that you and your friends can play undisturbed), the game offers team mode (2x2, 3x3, or 2x2x2) with teams of human players and/or AI bots. Gremlins, Inc. also supports a built-in spectator mode, which allows you to watch sessions of other players right from inside of the game, sharing your emotions with players and other spectators through messages and emoticons.</p>\n<p>CAN YOU PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE?<br />\nCertainly! When you buy this game, you get 2 products in your Steam Library: Gremlins, Inc. \u2013 the edition that is playable online in single-player and multiplayer modes, with full support of item drops and Steam Workshop; and Gremlins vs Automatons \u2013 the edition that is playable offline in single-player mode, without any connection to our server whatsoever.</p>\n<p>HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE SESSION?<br />\nThe game offers different session settings to make them fit your available time, and single-player mode offers automatic SAVE / LOAD function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you want (while multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast timer can finish in under 20 minutes, while a 4-player session for 60 rounds can last for 2 hours or more.</p>\n<p>SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES?<br />\nThere are different types of cards in the game (permanent, regular, secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either to move or for action, you will develop both short-term and long-term strategies for making the most out of where you are, and what you currently have in your hand. Normally, you spend half of your game time accumulating resources and building the foundation for the end-game, and the other half trying to control the progress of your opponents (stealing, arresting, initiating player conflicts, and so on). The more you play, the more new strategies you will discover \u2013 especially when combining the effects of several cards played in a combination.</p>\n<p>MAKE DECISIONS, PLAN YOUR MOVES<br />\nThis is an intense strategy game: make decisions at every round! Plan your moves, then adjust to the actions of the other players and new cards drawn.The design of the playing field and the multiple layers of optional features (that you can turn on or off, as you wish) allow for a variety of strategies. The more you play, the more roads to victory you discover, using a combination of features based on the particular setup of the session.The game offers a diverse resource system that allows for many comeback chances even after you&#39;re robbed or arrested (or both). With score, money, votes, malice, income and bribes, the tension often remains until the very last round.The multilayer mode of the game features a system of ratings, ladders and ranked sessions: compete in a specific league, and take part in the regularly organised tournaments with over 1,000 participants. A system of anonymous masks allows everyone to compete on equal terms in a ranked session.Additionally, the game offers over 10 single-player challenges plus the option to create custom single-player sessions with different settings and a different mix of AI bots.Finally, there&#39;s the team mode where victory is determined not only by strategic skill, but also by communication and coordination of each team, which is an entirely different layer of game mechanics.</p>\n<p>FACTS &amp; FIGURES<br />\n179 cards in the main deck (143 of them \u2013\u00a0unique): permanent, regular, secret and criminal, each with a hand-drawn steampunk illustration; with each Season update, we keep adding several new cards to the deck.38 events in the Misfortune deck: these are the special events triggered at certain moments in the game, and may affect the current standing of all players to a significant degree, especially when used on a specific opponent.6 special Chaos Cards: this is an optional set of cards available to every player in the game; turn them on or off to change the dynamics of the session.12 sets of Character Abilities: another optional feature that brings to the game special game mechanics unique to each character type; playing with these makes different competing strategies even more pronounced.11 original locations: the Office, the Plant, the Dump, the Marketplace, the Inferno, the Jail, the Casino, the Court, the Treasure, the Bank and the Astral Plane; and 7 original spot types: Risk, Gamble, Police, Income, Bribe, Misfortune and Tribune.Finally, the game took us three years to develop from concept to full release, and we&#39;re still committed to continue supporting the community through development of new content. There are currently over 120,000 players of Gremlins, Inc. on Steam from all over the world, including USA, Russia, China, Japan, UK and France. Collectively, players launched over one million game sessions in the three months since its release.</p>\n<p>FINALLY, WHO ARE THE GREMLINS?<br />\nYou think that\u2019s just a pocket watch in your hand, a watch that\u2019s a bit late because you keep forgetting to wind it up? No, no and no \u2013 you couldn\u2019t be further from the truth! What you carry around is a whole gremlin town packed into this tiny mechanism: a town with its own bank, its own casino\u2026 and even its own jail! Gremlins are the microscopic creatures that inhabit any mechanism that they can possibly infiltrate. If a watch or a telescope malfunctions, then it\u2019s probably due to gremlins who took up a residence there.</p>\n<p>More than anything in life, gremlins value money, political power and prestige: prestige that one can claim after completing some sort of a grandiose engineering project. Aside from working on their own projects, gremlins mostly spend their time preventing other gremlins from building something even more grandiose. This they achieve through bribing officials and lying to the electorate, as well through stealing from their competitors - and outright arresting them.</p>\n<p>A DISCLAIMER (JUST IN CASE)<br />\nWe felt it important to note that Gremlins, Inc. is not a free-to-play game. Also, this is not a CCG or TCG: you do not need to buy boosters or packs; in every session the game offers the same deck to every player, and everyone&#39;s chances are equal.</p>\n<p>OUR DLC POLICY<br />\nWe are committed to the principle of continuously updating the game with new features and new game content that come as regular updates, FREE to every owner of the product. At the same time, from time to time we release DLCs that feature fun cosmetic content. If you like it, you can support our efforts by your purchase. However, there is absolutely no pressure to own any of the DLCs in order to play the game or compete in the tournaments. Every player, whether they have DLCs or not, has access to the same game features and the same game mechanics.</p>\n<p>The game also supports crafting: once you find a blueprint of a specific item, you can create as many such items as you wish, as long as you have the required number of charges (you get charges when you convert other in-game items that you do not want, or have multiple copies of). Finally, the game has its own Steam Item Store where we sell a very small number of unique items that influence the item meta-game (but they have no effect on the game mechanics).</p>\n<p>ONLINE &amp; OFFLINE VERSIONS<br />\nGremlins, Inc. was designed as a digital board game with the multiplayer mode at its heart. However, this is not to say that we don&#39;t like single-player \u2013\u00a0we do, and there&#39;s a separate section with the single-player challenges as well as the mode where you can create any custom single-player session that you like! One of the products that you receive with this game, Gremlins, Inc., features both single-player and multiplayer modes, and requires that your game client is connected to both Steam and the game&#39;s server at all times \u2013\u00a0in order to support item drops, Steam Community Market and Steam Workshop. The other product that is included with the game, Gremlins vs Automatons, features single-player mode and is designed specifically to be played offline.</p>\n<p>AMSTERDAM AND SINGAPORE SERVERS<br />\nThe game currently supports 2 separate servers: Amsterdam and Singapore. Players are able to check their ping value for each of these servers, and play on the server that is the most convenient. Each server has its own player ladder, statistics and player profiles. Most players choose Amsterdam, since ping to Amsterdam from anywhere in the world rarely exceeds 300. However, as we saw more and more players from the Asian region join the game, especially from China, we added the server in Singapore in order to be able to offer faster connection specifically to these players. We hope that this works well for every player, as good player experience is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the quality of our server/client connection in order to adapt the servers to the changing requirements and we thank you for your patience.</p>"

The game uses the Unity graphics engine and came out on three operating systems: Windows, OS X, and Linux. The game was originally supposed to be dedicated to the programming of nanobots, which are launched into the body of a living person, but the developer opted for a more appealing idea for a setting.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The plot tells a story about the player finding the faulty TIS-100 computer and the manual to it. TIS (Tessellated Intelligence System) is similar to the first computers from the 80s. Each level looks like a 12 program of nodes, located by a grid of 3 to 4. Each node has a processor register, behind which a certain numerical value is hidden. In order to solve the puzzle, the player needs to reprogram the node so that they perform specific actions using a simplified version of the real assembly language. In the version for Steam Early Access, which was released in 2015, 25 levels were available for the completion. Their number reached 50 at a full release. Only a single story campaign is available in the game. The players noted that the game is an excellent exercise for all programmers who want to compete with each other in optimizing the code in a fictional multithread assembler.</p>"

During a game, each third map is community-made. After the time expires, a voting window appears, where the players can share their opinion on the map. If the map&#39;s rating gets lower than 50%, it gets removed from the game. </p>\n<p>Map categories were later added to the game. </p>\n<h3>Emotes</h3>\n<p>The players can use nine animated emotes: dance, laugh, cry, kiss, anger, applause, sleep, facepalm, and sit.

        "description": "<p>Edge is an isometric puzzle platformer. You control a cube and need to lead it through levels to the goal, collecting light prisms and trying not to fall off the map. You see the map from the isometric perspective, and the cube moves diagonally. There are 45 main and 3 unlockable levels in the game. </p>\n<p>The key feature of the gameplay is the ability of the cube to balance at the certain angle. You need this to complete the most difficult parts of the route. When rolling is not enough, you can climb a moving block to overcome an obstacle or perform any other maneuver. However, these tricks are not easy to master.</p>\n<p>However, Edge challenges your reflexes more than your ability to solve puzzles. The game usually gives direct hints about where to go and what to do to pass the level but it\u2019s quite difficult to perform this safely. Problems can appear only with collecting all the prisms as they can be hidden. In general, the entire game is created in simple polygonal style so nothing distracts you from completing levels.</p>"

This is one of the games released by an independent studio and timed to the release of the big Serious Sam 3: BFE. Version XXL game. Two years after the original release in 2011 as XXL version of the game was released as a free patch for all the owners of the original game.</p>\n<p>The game takes place in the same universe as all other games. The developers have tried to recreate as accurately as possible the original gameplay, which is Serious Sam famous for. And this is an enormous mob of monsters, attacking the protagonist from all sides. At levels, the player can find first-aid kits, weapons, and ammo. The game&#39;s arsenal includes both guns that were already in the game universe and entirely new weapons. Each can be upgraded, and new upgrades significantly simplify the completion of the game.</p>\n<p>Structurally, the game is divided into three episodes. At the end of each player faces a boss. Sometimes the game process is diluted by simple puzzles. One of the distinctive features of the game is the Gunstacker mechanic, which allows you to attach different types of weapons to each other to increase the lethal power. In addition to a single story campaign, the game has a local cooperative for two players.</p>"

The period for the world of the game is the middle of the 21st century, the time in which all the armed forces were dissolved, and the law-enforcement function was assigned to the police under the name Consortium. The hierarchy on the ship is similar to chess. The player takes control over one of the crew members - Bishop 6, an elite soldier. This is the first part of the trilogy.</p>\n<p>The structure of the plot of the game is often compared with Mass Effect Trilogy - because of the story branches, each playthrough differs from the previous one. A detailed background - the developers claim about 150 000 words in the script - only enhances the effect. Also note the unusual implementation of the dialogue tree: the developers sought to recreate lifelike conversations, each response changes the attitude of the NPCs to the main character. In total, more than 20 characters are available for communication, and the soundtrack of the game was written by the famous composer Jeremy Soule, who worked on such games as The Elder Scrolls V, Company of Heroes and Guild Wars.</p>"

In Clash, two teams fight over territory control. In a round of Link, your objective will be to capture several control points before your enemy breaks the link between the points.

The first-level collisions are mostly minor and lie in the field of damaging some constructions and crushing the billboards, while the second-level ones activate during the full bar completion are lead to the structural damage of the map facilities frequently leading to route changes and landscape altering.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Power Play mechanics is powered by the narrative underlining it as it tells the story of a TV Show, the participators of which are all the racers including our protagonist. The meter, in this case, represents the reviews watchers give to the show members. The computer-controlled opponents can also turn on the ability and crush something on the player&#39;s vehicle \u2014 so the audience votes not only for the protagonist.</p>"

All the events after that scene are Philips flashbacks.</p>\n<p>After the ending scene of the first game, where Philip got knocked out by an unknown man, he awakes in a locked room which he escapes through a vent. It is revealed that the mines that led the main character to where he is now are just a cover-up for a secret research base stationed in Greenland. The complex is deserted, all of its employees are dead or turned into mutants. Philips has to find a way out.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay has not changed since the first game. Black Plague is still a first-person survival horror, yet it puts more focus on the horror aspect of the game. Most of the quests present in the game were cut down and replaced by the item search puzzles. </p>\n<p>There is no combat system present in the game. The players have to either run away from their enemies or stick to the shadows. It is impossible to stop the enemies, as they can break down doors. Throwing crates at the enemies does not help much, as they are only distracted by that for a few seconds. </p>\n<h3>Gold Edition features</h3>\n<p>The only feature of the Gold Edition is the addition of the third Penumbra game, Requiem.</p>"

The player assumes the role of Cole MacGrath, a regular delivery man who miraculously survived a deadly explosion that destroyed much of the city. This trauma somehow gave Cole a superhuman power to control electricity. His powers can be used to move, attack and defend, and over the course of the game, he will discover a lot of new abilities. The powers are not infinite, and Cole needs to be charged with more electricity. It depends on you if MacGrath will use them for the greater good or becomes a villain. Every choice he makes in the game will affect his Karma, making him more Good or Evil. The central plot, however, does not depend on your Karma meter and only varies based on certain player actions. Because of his high electric charge, the protagonist cannot drive vehicles. MacGrath moves around the town on feet, often climbing up the roofs and using his parkour skills.</p>"

One of the core narrative features is a 3D realistic background and live captured videos instead of usual cutscenes. All of the games within a series feature the self-titled protagonist with a setting in 2050. Tesla Effect uncovers the story of a Chelsee Bando disappearance. The first part of the title cues the players into realizing the role of Nicola Tesla in the narrative.<br />\nIt is little to invent in the point-and-click genre, but the development of Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure is presumably cut into two parts: actual cutscene and backgrounds filming and composing it all into the game content. The game features 5 endings and branching paths within the characters&#39; arcs. The choices within those arcs influence the ending outcome.</p>"

The game was the fifth in the series, but the third one that received a number in the name. Originally released only on PC and Mac, but later it was ported to both consoles and mobile devices running Android, iOS, Java ME and Windows Phone. The developers called the game \u201cthe biggest Bejeweled experience available to date.\u201d The game is available for free at partner sites.</p>\n<h3>What to do?</h3>\n<p>The goal of the game has not changed compared to the previous parts: the player must match three identical in color gem, which, if all is correct, they disappear. Rows of gems are constantly moving, and the game adds the random new gems on top screen. Thus, the player can launch a chain reaction and earn many points at once.</p>\n<h3>What\u2019s new?</h3>\n<p>In the new part of Bejeweled, four new game modes appeared as well as new sound effects and improved graphics. However, this is true not for all versions of the game: so in the Java ME version, players have only four game modes available due to hardware limitations. There is Zen mode also in the game - a new one. There, players can customize the audio and visual components of the game and create their own meditative experience. There is no plot in the game, but you can earn 65 badges to prove the ultimate player\u2019s skill.</p>"

Space Rangers HD: A War Apart is an improved version of the second part of the Space Rangers, which includes all the additional content for the game, and a completely new one. The publisher of the game was the company 1C.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The player takes control of the pirate ship, which occupies the lowest step in the hierarchy of space bandits. The main task is to get to the top. To do this, you will have to carry out missions and learn new details about the mysterious leader of the organization. He is the enemy of the Coalition of sentient species. All actions of the player influence the virtual world and the decisions made change the ending of the game. In the updated version of the game, new graphics are available: players now have the ability to play in resolution up to 1920x1200. Developers also added new storylines and fifteen new tracks to the music library of the game. Like the original game, Space Rangers HD, it was positively received both by longtime fans of the series and by new players. Critics also spoke positively.</p>"

There are four playable campaigns, wherein two, the player can choose between different countries of interest, and lead their troops in the Wars of Coalition, and the other two smaller campaigns focus on Napoleon\u2019s earlier conquests. Each campaign has a set of missions to accomplish, with different objectives and varying difficulty.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>As with other games of Total War series, there are two main game modes, the geopolitical turn-based mode, where the player has to build up his cities, recruit armies and plan their conquests, and the battle mode, where the player can manually command his troops to outplay the enemy in tactics. There are many variables in combat, as units may take attrition, can have lower morale according to the current situation on the battlefield, and so on.</p>\n<h3>Graphics and other features</h3>\n<p>The game features a multiplayer mode, where players take control of the different countries from the period, and face against each other, engage in diplomacy, forge unlikely alliances, and many more. The engine of the game redefines battles, as the physics have improved, leaving a great impact on how the game looks. Cannon strikes leave craters, guns fire in unison; troops fall from a successful flanking, everything in battle now has a certain feel, as if you are really on the field.</p>"

Robots must find and kill all players to get out of the island on which the action of the game unfolds. The landscape of the island is different during each playthrough - procedurally generated mechanics help to do so: the game engine chooses from five main themes - from the countryside to industrial areas.</p>\n<p>Players need to look for food and weapons to survive, besides, to spare parts for transport. The latter serves as the only way out of the island. Most of the game process is within the genre of stealth, so do not expect dazzling action from this game.</p>"

The player assumes the role of Arkwright, a genius scientist who invented a new type of automaton called Fluro. The Fluros are amorphous creatures that can be made of any type of liquid and perform tasks for people. One day, the Fluros mutated and went out of control, ruining most of the world\u2019s machines. Arkwright has to find the cause of the malfunction and restore control over the Fluros. <br />\nThe gameplay consists of solving physics-based puzzles and manipulating the ridiculously complex machinery in a 2.5D environment. Arkwright jumps the platforms and pushes buttons to activate machines in a certain way. He can also use devices called Seeds to create new Fluros out of the liquids found on the levels, including lava. The Fluros, in turn, can be manipulated to perform helpful actions, such as to pull switches that are inaccessible for Arkwright. The liquid is the central element of the game, and a special graphics engine was made to animate it. The music by the famous DJ Jon Hopkins works as a hint for the player, becoming more complex when he or she does the right actions.</p>"

This is the only game within the IP.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Every action in the game is tied with the typing words on the keyboard. Thus, the game cannot be ported onto consoles. Unlike the games similar to this genre, Typing Chronicles utilize every adventure-game mechanics to be adapted to typing words.<br />\nFor example, enemies may not die from one hit, so there are several words above their heads. The meaning of the written information often corresponds to the situation on the screen.<br />\nApart from battles, the protagonist may solve puzzles and explore the world. <br />\nThe gameplay is the main attraction of the game \u2014 however, it turned its back on the players when it comes to the replayability. The title is monotonous with no gameplay sections without having to type the words.</p>\n<h3>Story</h3>\n<p>The plot tells a story of a poet who sent his muse into the world of unfinished tales to seek for ideas to the next story. The text of the ultimate masterpiece unravels, as Muse proceeds through the levels on her three-tailed fox, changing the environment around her. Somewhere in-between the levels, the semantic idea of interconnecting the meaning with the object faints a little, but the ending is set to explain this minor inconvenience.</p>"

Rising Storm 2: Vietnam casts players into a brutal, authentic recreation of the Vietnam War.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rising Storm 2: Vietnam offers intense tactical action for up to <strong>64 players</strong> in battles between the US forces and the Vietnamese, with each force having their own unique abilities and tactical advantages such as Napalm Strikes, Artillery Barrages, surface-to-air missiles, traps, ambushes and more. <br/><br/><br/><br/>A variety of authentic period weapons available including the M16, M14, M60, M79 and M3 Grease Gun for the Americans; and the Type 56 Assault Rifle (a Chinese copy of the famous AK-47), RPG-7, MAT-49, SKS Carbine and many, many more for the Vietcong. <br/><br/>Weapons also have a wide range of functionality with in-game implications, including adjustable stocks, attachable bayonets, and a new and advanced recoil system which builds on the already phenomenal weapon handling that the Red Orchestra series is famous for.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Players on the US team will be able to pilot 3 different helicopters - the UH-1H \"Huey\" transport, the OH-6 \"Loach\" light recon and the powerful AH-1G \"Cobra\" attack helicopter. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Play as both the United States Military and Vietnamese resistance fighters. Rising Storm 2: Vietnam allows players to control either the U.S. Army and Marines Corps or the militarized and guerrilla forces of North Vietnam - the NVA and the Viet Cong.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Each map faithfully recreates the look of the Vietnam experience and aims to pull players directly into the war with its extreme authenticity to real life. <br/><br/>Maps will include the famous jungles of Vietnam, but will also cover battles that occurred in cities, on rolling hills, in US Firebases, Rice Fields, Plantations and many more authentic locations.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Game types include Red Orchestra's classic territory control mode, the new Supremacy mode, for large-scale combat including helicopters, VC tunnels and more, as well as the new smaller Skirmish mode and maps designed for 16 or less players. <br/><br/>These new smaller maps are designed to be a more competitive, squad-based experience that reflect the small unit actions that Vietnam is famous for.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Enhanced squad system that allows players to set up squads as they want them - name them, add their friends, set the squad tag color in game. Once in game, easy identification of your squad in the world and on maps - and dedicated VOIP channels for the squad, as well as bonuses for working together.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rising Storm 2: Vietnam's focus will be player skill and balance. We won't be locking content like weapon upgrades, improved player characteristics or new armaments behind a rank or experience system. We want to put the tools to succeed in the hands of every player.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rising Storm 2: Vietnam will allow players to customize their player characters with additional uniform and equipment variants earned as they play. These will include new headgear, clothing, tattoos, glasses and more."

        "description": "<p>Network multiplayer shooter from the first person (with the ability to change the camera into a third-person mode) - claiming the title of the fastest. The game is the continuation of the Tribes series.</p>\n<p>The series includes games such as: Starsiege: Tribes, Tribes 2, Tribes: Aerial Assault, Tribes: Vengeance and Tribes: Ascend.</p>\n<h3>The general plot of the series</h3>\n<p>The plot of the series begins in 2471, when a scientist Solomon Petresun invents the first cybrid, a bio-cybernetic hybrid artificial intelligence named Prometheus. After this invention begins mass production of cybrids, which are intended to be used as slaves. However, in 2602 Prometheus grows and directs all cybrids against humanity.</p>\n<h3>Chronology series</h3>\n<p>The earliest events of this story occur in the game Tribes: Vengeance which was released in 2004.<br />\nThe events of the next period are covered in the game Starsiege: Tribes, although the game itself came out before Tribes: Vengeance, in 1998. Then the story opens in Tribes 2, released in 2001.<br />\nThe Tribes Aerial Assault, 2002 does not follow the events of the plot of the remaining games, although it is located within the general setting.<br />\nFinally, the last game of the series today is Tribes: Ascend, released in 2012.</p>\n<h3>Terrain</h3>\n<p>The area in which the events unfold is very extensive. It consists mainly of hills, slopes and mountains. Anything else, such as buildings, is rare.</p>\n<h3>Player Classes</h3>\n<p>At the beginning of a match, each player chooses a character class. Classes are only three. Class can be changed during the game.</p>\n<p>Light class - health and weapons of this class are weak, but this class has a high speed, it can become invisible and attack at a great distance from the sniper rifle. He is the best if you need to steal a flag or catch up with those who have already done it.</p>\n<p>The middle class is average in everything - in health, armament and mobility. But this is not only the average level of everything, it is also a good balance between all the qualities.</p>\n<p>Heavy class has the largest health reserve and powerful heavy weapons. Equally good in attack and defense, but moves slower than all, sluggish.</p>\n<h3>Special equipment and abilities</h3>\n<p>All three classes have a jetpack, allowing you to fly through the air. But the height of the climb depends on the chosen character class. All characters can slide on the surface, the speed of sliding is high, but depends on the mass of the character, and hence, on his class.</p>\n<h3>Modes</h3>\n<p>Team fight.<br />\nCapture and retention.<br />\nCapture the Flag, CtF is the main game mode. In this mode, tactics of behavior is of particular importance.<br />\nCapture the Flag &quot;blitz&quot; (CtF Blitz) - the main difference from conventional CtF is that after each successful capture the enemy flag moves closer to the rear of its base.<br />\nArena 5X5.</p>"

Source (2007). </p>\n<h3>Zombies</h3>\n<p>The game&#39;s portrayal of zombies was borrowed from John Romero&#39;s The Living Dead film series. This kind of zombies is faster, smarter, and very aggressive. They are easily attracted by the loud sounds, which makes use of firearms dangerous. The game also includes melee weapons for silent kills, but they are weaker. </p>\n<p>A unique feature in Contagion is that the dead players respawn not as humans but as an even stronger and faster type of a zombie. They join the other side and can help the AI-controlled undead.</p>\n<h3>Game modes</h3>\n<p>There are three main modes in Contagion and an additional Flatline mode. Hunted mode is competitive and pits the players against not only zombies but also each other in a classic deathmatch. The last survivor wins the game. This mode allows up to 16 players to participate.</p>\n<p>The other two modes are cooperative and are only that allow the single-player walkthrough. Escape mode requires the players to survive together as a team of up to eight players. They enter a level and try to complete a series of quests while fighting off an AI-controlled zombie horde. Their main objective is to escape the level alive. Extraction is a stronghold-type mode. It tasks the players with searching the human NPCs on a map and protecting them from a wave of the undead.</p>"

The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots&#39; behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.<br />\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you&#39;re allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn&#39;t right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren&#39;t in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!<br />\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy&#39;s?<br />\n&quot;For all the simplicity of the game\u2019s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy\u2018s is frightening. It\u2019s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It\u2019s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.&quot; -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com<br />\nThis game was created using Clickteam Fusion!</p>"

The game is heavily inspired by the classic action flicks, such as The Matrix, and movies by John Woo.</p>\n<p>Double Action is a third-person shooter which revolves around fast-paced combat and fluid movement, which can be found in Max Payne. Influenced by Max Payne, the game features the bullet time system which slows down the in-game passage of time that helps the players land much more precise shots. </p>\n<p>The objective in the match of the game is to become the most stylish player with the highest number of style points. The style points are awarded for killing enemies while diving, doing flips, attempting slides and attempting such tricks. Slow-motion seconds are also awarded for stylish gameplay.</p>\n<p>The game does not feature objective-driven matches, yet from time to time a special objective may be activated, such as Capture the Briefcase, Kill the Wanted One, Race to the Finish. Should a player complete the special objective, they are allowed to execute a special style move that acts as all the style moves combined. That adds a whole another layer to the gameplay.</p>\n<p>There are nine weapons present in the game: two pistols, several SMGs, a shotgun, two rifles, your own fists, and a grenade. The pistols can be dual-wielded.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Source Filmmaker is a video creation program developed by Valve on Source game engine.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>Valve uses Source Filmmaker to create trailers and short movies on their games. The most notable video series made to date is Meet the Team and several Team Fortress 2, Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2 videos. Usually, Source Filmmaker is used in cases when the creators need to dynamically change the character&#39;s facial expressions or much more cinematic movement animations. </p>\n<p>The capture process is fairly easy - the creators have to record the movement of each character present in the scene, record their animations, add camera movement, sounds, and only after that, it is possible to properly record the facial animations, change the lighting, and add special effects. All these things can be done directly throught Source Filmmaker without resorting to any other software.</p>\n<p>Source Filmmaker supports a wide range of cinematic special effects and post-processing filters. The creators can use any assets of Valve games that are made on Source free of charge. It is also possible to use the resources of the community-made Source mods that are published on Steam, or add their own ones directly into the Source Filmmaker.</p>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>Valve puts a heavy emphasis on the educational value of Source Filmmaker, as the company helps out the animators, by publishing the source files for their videos, and holds the annual Saxxy Awards, where the most notable SFM works are given awards from Valve.</p>"

        "description": "<h3>Licensing issues</h3>\n<p>Pinball Arcade is the meticulous digitization of real analog pinball machines. The licensing was provided to developers from FarSight Studios by Gottlieb, Alvin G. and Company, and Stern Pinball. In addition to a fairly straightforward development process, in parallel developers were negotiating the licensing of gaming tables. As a result, it was possible to negotiate for a certain period, and as of 2018, some types of gaming tables are not available for the game because the license was over. In total, more than sixty tables disappeared, most of which were included in paid DLCs.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The game came out on all possible platforms: including the most recent ones like Nintendo Switch, Sony PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. On the PC game is available for free, but for new tables, players have to pay. There is no plot in the game, and all the attention of the developers were focused on recreating all the smallest details of the gaming tables and the physics of the ball. The rest is a usual pinball: the player has access to the field and the ball, the main task is to beat out as many points as possible for three attempts, that is, without dropping the ball. You can catch it and toss it again with the help of two sticks that is the only player-controlled object in the entire playing field.</p>"

The government cannot do anything with widespread crime, so it simply ignores that. Four street fighters from a gypsy community unwillingly become the test subjects for a new drug called Necro. After escaping from the laboratory, the main character returns back to their community only to find it in ruins and the whole population becoming drug addicts. The protagonist becomes eager to get revenge on those, who did that. Further into the game, the main character starts taking Necro themselves, which causes horrible hallucinations.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Mother Russia Bleeds is a beat &#39;em up game which is largely inspired by titles such as Streets of Rage and Double Dragon.</p>\n<p>The players advance through a level, that is divided into multiple sections. In progress further, the players have to kill every enemy they encounter in a section. At the end of each level, a boss fight is held.</p>\n<p>Apart from hand-to-hand combat, the players can use the world&#39;s items, such as pipes, knives, bottles, and pistols. One of the defining features of the game is the health regeneration system, as the players can pump Necro out of their enemies corpses and eject them to themselves. A choice is given - regenerate health or become a berserk that has much more strength and speed.</p>\n<p>The game can either be completed solo or in a four-player co-op.</p>"

Frank enters the city by helicopter, the helicopter pilot is told to return to Frank in 72 hours. Frank quickly finds himself in a shopping center, where a crowd of people are trying to hide from the zombies - as it turns out, it was zombies that caused the closure of the city.</p>\n<p>Over the next 72 hours (this time is one of the strict conditions of the game), Frank must survive, save a few people and understand where the zombies came from. Along the way, he fights with zombies, seeks solutions, makes weapons and takes photographs - he is still a photojournalist. For successful shots, he gets more experience, which is appreciated in the game.</p>\n<h3>Wheelchair with machine guns</h3>\n<p>The second game &quot;forgets&quot; about Frank, it features a motorcyclist Chuck Green, who arrives in Willamet after all has settled down. There is a drug against turning into a zombie now, it is expensive, but effective. However, the new invasion of the zombie is still happening, Chuck drives around the town on a wheelchair with a pair of rifles, shooting hordes of zombies and simultaneously showing a touching concern for his daughter, who is somewhere nearby and needs a cure for zombification.</p>\n<h3>Zombies give a second chance</h3>\n<p>The third game &quot;resurrects&quot; Frank, who after success in the first game managed to fall to the bottom of life. In search of a new chance to succeed, Frank returns to Willameth, who seems to have been cleared of zombies twice, but Frank is very lucky - zombies capture the city for the third time. This time there are more enemies, among them many new ones. There are also more types of weapons - those that you need to do yourself from improvised means. Frank will visit places in the city that he did not suspect. Especially impressive will be a visit to the amusement park - &quot;Uranus Zone&quot;.</p>"

The serve as a long-range damage dealer, deadly area damage dealer, fast melee attacker, and a supportive class. Just like in MOBA games, Forced features both active and passive abilities that are weapon class-specific. If a cooperative mode is played, the players have to choose different classes, as the game will not allow your party to play otherwise. The game also adjusts the difficulty accordingly if played in cooperative mode. </p>\n<p>After completing each mission of the game, the players are awarded gems. These gems can be used to upgrade your weapons and unlock their new abilities. The players can get three gems max per mission.</p>"

At this point, the technological advancements allowed people to augment their bodies and enter virtual reality. Most importantly, the robotic assistants called ROMs became increasingly popular and largely replaced the regular phones. The main producer of the robots is a corporation called Parallax, and it plans to create a new kind of fully independent AI. There&#39;s a rebel party called Human Revolution that aims to stop the progress of the AI.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The main engineer of Parallax, Hayden Webber, recently was abducted. The main protagonist is a journalist who researches the Webber&#39;s disappearance. He or she is accompanied by Turing, a highly advanced robotic assistant. They go on a search in the fictional city of Neo-San Francisco on the eve of Christmas.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>2064: Read Only Memories works as a point-and-click adventure game with a static first-person view. The environment and characters are presented to the player as slightly animated images. He or she can interact with them by clicking and choosing options, such as to look at, to take, or to speak to. </p>\n<h3>Style</h3>\n<p>The game is made in the vein of the 1980s and 1990s graphic adventure games. It uses pixel art visual style with minimal animation and neon-lighted environments, accompanied by a synthwave music score.</p>"

As with the rest of the Driver series, the main character is John Tanner, a police detective, and a talented driver. Tanner is chasing the mobster Charles Jericho who survived the events of Driver 3. </p>\n<p>While awaiting trial in San Francisco, Jericho escapes the custody and wrecks chaos in the city. Tanner is injured and falls into a coma. While unconscious, the protagonist discovers he has a supernatural power to inhabit other people&#39;s bodies. It allows him to continue the chase.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is set in a thoroughly modeled San Francisco complete with its famous landmarks. Unlike in the three previous games, Tanner cannot leave the car and walk around. Instead, Driver: San Francisco introduces a new option called Shift, using which the protagonist instantly changes vehicles. This is explained as a supernatural ability to switch bodies. </p>\n<p>The game also reintroduces the popular Film Director mode. It allows the player to replay his or her adventures using various cameras so that the walkthrough video looks almost like a movie.</p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>The game is the first in the series to introduce both local and online multiplayer. There are several modes that include a vehicular tag game and other variations of a competitive chase game.</p>"

From time to time, a developer hosted mega-game is held on live multiplayer servers. Although the players can battle on different planets in one galaxy, there is no space combat present in the game. Instead, the game focuses on land and naval combat. </p>\n<p>It is possible to use the planet&#39;s moons as army carriers, and gravity plays an important role in the gameplay as it can be used to damage the enemy army. Players take control of a Commander. Commanders are strong units and essential units in the game. They can only build base buildings without any specialization. If the Commander gets killed, the player loses the match. The faction&#39;s Commanders do not differ in their abilities or gameplay, yet they feature a distinct visual style.</p>\n<p>There is no singleplayer campaign present in the game, yet it is possible to play offline with the help of AI bots.</p>"

In Knights of Pen &amp; Paper, the player controls a group of people who participate in a tabletop role-playing session. The Dungeon Master is also under player&#39;s control.

The game has a total of 19 characters with personalities like &quot;Little Brother&quot;, &quot;Hipster&quot; or &quot;Nerd&quot;. 14 of the characters are available from the start and 5 bonus &quot;Dev Crew&quot; characters can be unlocked. Each character has his or her personal bonus ability.</p>\n<h3>Style</h3>\n<p>The game is made in a &quot;retro&quot; pixelated visual style and is set to simple chiptune music.

It takes place in the world of Evolandia and follows a typical story of a chosen one and his fight against evil forces. The game\u2019s dialogues, items descriptions, and overall style are filled with humor, parody, and references to iconic video game series. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The main feature of the game is unlocking of graphical, sound and gameplay improvements. The game starts as a monochrome top-down adventure with no sound and gradually, as the player progresses through the story, transforms into full-fledged 3D RPG with soundtrack, different settlements throughout the game world, side-quests, NPCs and equipment system. <br />\nEvoland\u2019s gameplay continually changes. It can be divided into three main parts, each one resembling a certain game series. The first is top-down adventure similar to older The Legend of Zelda titles. Like Zelda, it features different puzzles and dungeons throughout the game. Then the game changes its combat system to turn-based imitating Final Fantasy series with its random encounters and party system. After that, it becomes the top-down hack-n-slash game in the style of Diablo series with the accent on obtaining various loot.</p>"

        "description": "Unique fusion of a top down shooter and tower defense strategy. You are the X-Morph - an alien species that invades Earth to harvest its resources and terraform the surface. Strategize in the build mode by carefully selecting various types of alien towers or throw yourself right into heat of the battle. Build mazes for incoming enemies in an environment that provides exceptional planning freedom. Tear down buildings and collapse bridges to support your defense or to simply indulge in a spectacle of unprecedented destruction. Possess a range of unique alien weapons and use defense strategies like you've never seen before in this genre.<br/>Your goal is to defend the X-Morph harvesters from waves of incoming human forces. Each enemy wave is preceded by a setup phase in which the player can check what types of enemies are going to be attacking him and to observe their paths. There is no time limit for this phase, so the player can carefully plan his defenses or choose to start fighting immediately and place towers when needed during the battle. One of the game's key features is the ability to build towers virtually anywhere on the map and to shape enemy paths by connecting towers with laser fences. The player can choose between building long mazes out of basic towers or placing more advanced towers which are more effective at different types of incoming enemies. Advanced tower types specialize in dealing with specific enemy types e.g. flame towers are great for destroying fast moving ground units, artillery towers are best at countering large groups of slow enemies, anti air laser is ideal for shooting down heavy bombers.<br/>As the X-Morph fighter you can engage enemy units directly with a diverse arsenal of weapons. You can morph into four distinct forms which specialize in dealing with different kinds of threats. Each form has a basic attack and a special charged attack mode. The Plasma Fighter is the most universal form - good at destroying both air and ground units. The Dark Matter Bomber is great at decimating groups of ground units. It can also slow down time and release a dark matter bomb that can cut down buildings. The Shredder fighter is perfect for annihilating large numbers of human air units and clearing the sky. Finally the Laser Destroyer is best for smelting large single units. It can also charge up a gravitational anomaly that sucks in smaller enemy units.  A large variety of weapons and enemies along with a dynamic, fully destructible environment provides a rich arcade shooter experience.<br/>The game's environments are constructed with a lot of attention to detail and they are almost completely destructible. From small picket fences to huge skyscrapers. Any bridge or building in the game can be collapsed and it's destruction is dynamically simulated using realistic physics. The destruction is not only a visual effect as it can significantly influence the layout of the battlefield. The combination of dynamic environments, laser fences and real time calculated enemy paths creates unique gameplay scenarios.<br/>Humans are desperate to defend their home world. They have created huge, building size, mechanical war machines to fight against each other, but now they will use them to destroy the X-Morph. Each boss fight is unique and heavily influences the gameplay environment. Entire cities will be destroyed.<br/>X-Morph: Defence includes a split screen co-op mode. All missions have different gameplay scenarios designed specifically for co-op play. Enemies attack in larger numbers and from new directions making good cooperation essential to winning. In this mode the game can be played in many different ways, one player can focus on optimizing tower placement while the other shoots at enemies or they can both focus their firepower on the strongest attackers."

Just like in the game, the snow reacts in reality to skiing or snowboarding.<br />\nthat</p>"

        "description": "<p>Waveform is a simple puzzle game in which the player controls the length and amplitude of a wave. The game is inspired by the particle physics and the wave-particle duality.</p>\n<h3>Style</h3>\n<p>Waveform is set to the background of space, filled with stars and nebulas. Occasionally, a familiar planet such as Earth will appear in the background, indicating that we are traveling through the Solar system. The game is accompanied by the electronic ambient music score.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The wave of light under player&#39;s control has a shape of a sinus curve. It serves as a route for a particle that flies forward through space. On its way, it will encounter other photons of varying colors that the player has to collect to set a higher score. </p>\n<p>The game has around 100 levels of varying difficulty. The player will encounter a number of level features that increase the complexity of the game as he or she progresses. The dark matter is an obstacle to avoid. Mirrors reflect the particle, making it bounce back on its way. Some obstacles may even eliminate the particle.</p>\n<h3>Controls</h3>\n<p>The player controls the wave with his or her mouse. Moving the mouse left or right changes the wavelength, while up and down movements influence the amplitude. The player has to adjust the wave to navigate the particle along the route. Increasing the amplitude will also speed up the particle as it moves up and down on the screen. Meanwhile, its horizontal speed stays the same, in full accordance with the Theory of relativity.</p>"

The names of cities in the game world are consonant with the names of the real cities of this region and neighboring countries. For example, Klaipedia is located in the South of the Kingdom within the Klaipedia region. The city is one of the main cities in the game&#39;s world. It is connected to West Siauliai Woods, the starting point for all the new Revelators. The name of this city is made from the name of the real city in Lithuania - Klaipeda.</p>\n<h3>Wealth of choice</h3>\n<p>The choice in the game is very diverse, there is no fixed route.</p>\n<p>You can search for the goddess in your own style - the game provides many opportunities for this in Massive Freedom of Choice mode. You have a huge selection of costumes and expressions. In any mode, different jobs, skills, and stats are available.</p>\n<h3>Training skills</h3>\n<p>If there is a lack of skills for success in the game - you can gain skill in the Team Battle League mode.</p>\n<p>There are many character classes and 8 ranks. Each combination of class and rank is interesting in its own way. There are also classes that are simply not accessible, you have to satisfy special requirements so that these classes become available.</p>\n<p>The game has a lot of hidden quests.</p>\n<h3>Severe test</h3>\n<p>If you are completely confident in your abilities, welcome to the Guild Wars mode - there are no safe places, there are no places where enemies can not reach, either in the open field or in the dungeons. By the way, in the whole game there are more than 200 unique boss monsters.</p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>If you want to play in the company - the community can be accessed anytime no matter where you may be. There is also Automatic Party Finding - make parties with nearby players.</p>\n<h3>Statistics</h3>\n<p>Any data about your status is visible throughout the game.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Human Resource Machine is an educational game in which the player assumes the role of a program algorithm. The gameplay is a metaphorical representation of a visual programming language. The protagonist represents the processor register, and the player&#39;s instructions to the character stand in for the opcodes.</p>\n<h3>Premise</h3>\n<p>The main character is an office clerk who works in a storage department. His career lasts 40 years, each of them corresponding to an in-game puzzle. Two conveyor belts in the protagonist&#39;s office work as the input and the output devices, respectively. The input conveyor brings in the numbers and letters in the form of boxes. The protagonist is instructed to perform certain tasks and calculations with the boxes before sending them back through the output conveyor. The tasks usually require simple mathematical actions such as sorting and addition. The boxes remain stored on the office floor until the task is completed.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls the character using commands that remind the assembly language. The handwritten notes represent the instructions the player gives to the character. As the player progresses through the puzzles, the game introduces more complicated concepts and mechanics, such as memory addresses. This feature allows the player to order the character to perform operations in the certain place of the office. The goal of each level is to create a program. The game will test the results and inform the player if it works or not (through a supervisor character).</p>"

The game first appeared on the public in 2009 on the developer&#39;s site and the Impulse site, and later appeared on Steam in version 2.0.</p>\n<h3>Interesting mix</h3>\n<p>The developers tried to combine in the game at once three genres: real-time strategy, tower defense, and 4X-strategy. Players and critics celebrated the unique gameplay but at the same time a fairly long process of learning the basics of the game. The main rivals of the players are two AI, the main goal - to destroy their planets. AI at the start has unfair advantages over the player, controlling the huge fleets of spacecraft. The game map usually consists of 10 to 120 star systems, its size greatly affects the game strategy necessary for victory.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The main feature of the game is the confrontation of players with artificial intelligence. According to the developers in AI War, this problem was solved: the local computer can think on three levels, adapt to the player&#39;s style of the opponent&#39;s game and surprise with illogical moves and attacks for the robot. DLC for the game, in addition to new units, maps and soundtrack, brought new types of artificial intelligence, victory over which becomes for players a kind of puzzle.</p>"

Its dynamic real-time combat with slow mode requires tactical awareness and careful preparation of the party.<br/><br/>At the moment the content is for approximately 15 hours of game-play time on normal or lower difficulty, excluding optional battle challenges.Before you buy:If you are looking for a game that is trying to bring something new to RPG genre - Tower of Time is an attempt at just that. If you are not sure if you like the combat we implemented - before you buy - please check some YT clips or visit our YT channel, where we uploaded the combat gameplay recorded and commented by an actual player. This is not a turn-based combat, rather a combination of <strong>RPG</strong> and <strong>RTS</strong> on a small scale, where you have the ability to slow time at will.<br/><br/>On <strong>Hard </strong> difficulty the game is meant to be hard, requiring your undivided attention throughout the entire combat encounter.<br/><br/>On <strong>Epic</strong> difficulty - there is only one party/skill/item composition for each enemy/boss type that we know of - one mistake will likely wipe your party. You must be in full control of the battle every second. Experimentation and thinking outside-of-the-box will ensure your success here.Features:<ul><li> Engaging story \u2013 set in a world where technology met magic with devastating consequences. Hundreds of lore books and scattered pieces of information slowly reveal the history of Artara as the protagonist approaches his fate. <br/></li><li> Novel combat system \u2013 unique real-time action with a slow-time feature, where each match is played on one of many separate tactical maps. Plan ahead and position your party accordingly. Use slow-time to react to new threats or negate enemy skills. No two encounters are ever the same.<br/></li><li> Five difficulty levels: You can choose whether you want only to enjoy the story or test your tactical thinking and skills.  <br/></li><li> Build your party around typical tank/dps/support composition or try something entirely new. <br/></li><li> Different combat scenarios - e.g. Swarm or Only Elite - will ensure that combat is not repetitive.<br/></li><li> Find secret locations, cleverly hidden in the environment. Travel through hand-crafted levels where every single place is carefully designed. <br/></li><li> Seven classes to choose from, and your party can be adjusted at will and anytime, depending on the challenges you face. Each champion has unique skills that can be upgraded and re-trained at will. (In Early Access six champions are available, as the seventh joins your party at lower levels).<br/></li><li> New character progression system: there is no experience to gain. Instead, discover ancient knowledge to unlock new skills and carefully design your characters. Each character could be turned into a powerful and durable attacker or a skill-based champion. <br/></li><li> Defeat powerful elite enemies (bosses) wielding diverse skills and spells. Assess their strengths and weaknesses carefully to succeed. <br/></li><li> Complete combat challenges for item rewards and unique enchanting recipes, or just to test your new party setup. <br/></li><li> Random loot system. Craft item of your choice and power, using crafting crystals of various types. Discover ancient enchanting recipes that can change the nature of the combat, granting regeneration aura or immunity to special effects. <br/></li><li> Upgrade your city as the main training/equipment hub and repository of all the lore you find.</li></ul>Story:For long ages past, Artara was a place of great peace and beauty. Then, a mysterious event took place. Within a few generations, the land was broken and the skies darkened. More than a thousand years of decline has passed since then.<br/><br/>As a young boy, you came upon the base of an immense Tower, uncovered by yet another violent earthquake. Deep below sleeps an ancient power. Since that day, you have been drawn inexorably to this place. Your task is to lead a group of champions and reach whatever resides in the depths of the Tower. There you will face the ultimate choice\u2026"

Such titles are also called 2,5D platformers. The protagonist encounters waves of enemies, and the player chooses between the various weaponry to deal with them.

It was inspired by supernatural thrillers like Twin Peaks and X-Files.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>As its name suggests, the game is set in Virginia, in a fictional country town called Kingdom. A small boy named Lucas Fairfax disappeared recently. The main protagonist, a young and inexperienced FBI agent Anne Tarver, has to uncover the mystery and find the child. Since she lacks the necessary experience, Tarver is accompanied by a higher ranking agent Maria Halperin. The two don&#39;t trust each other, but they have to overcome their differences and work together.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Virginia&#39;s gameplay is similar to interactive movies and &quot;walking simulators.&quot; The player controls Anne and travels around the city, accompanied by Halperin, to find clues and learn more about what&#39;s going on in the city. The player has no actual control over the actions of the protagonist. Instead, he or she can only navigate Tarver over the city and then watch her act. The game is very short, and two hours is usually enough to complete it.</p>\n<h3>Style</h3>\n<p>The game is made in an intentionally low-poly visual style. There are no dialogues, neither in subtitles nor voice acting. The player can only understand the narrative through the facial expressions and body language of the characters, as well as the other clues.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Doom (typeset as DOOM in official documents) is a 1993 science fiction horror-themed first-person shooter (FPS) video game by id Software. It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in video game history, for having helped to pioneer the now-ubiquitous first-person shooter. The original game was divided into three nine-level episodes and was distributed via shareware and mail order. The Ultimate Doom, an updated release of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.</p>\n<p>In Doom, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became popularly known as &quot;Doomguy&quot;, fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell. With one-third of the game (nine levels) distributed as shareware, Doom was played by an estimated 15\u201320\u00a0million people within two years of its release, popularizing both the business model of online distribution and the mode of gameplay, and spawning a gaming subculture. In addition to popularizing the first-person shooter genre, it pioneered immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as &quot;WADs&quot;. As a sign of its effect on the industry, first-person shooter games from the genre&#39;s boom in the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game&#39;s release, became known simply as &quot;Doom clones&quot;. Its graphic violence, as well as satanic imagery, made Doom the subject of considerable controversy.</p>\n<p>The Doom franchise was later continued with the follow-up Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994) and numerous expansion packs, including Master Levels for Doom II (1995), and Final Doom (1996). Originally released for MS-DOS, the games have been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game&#39;s source code was released in 1997, it spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the Doom game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have continued making Wads, speedruns, and modifications to the original. The franchise again received popular attention in 2004 with the release of Doom 3, a retelling of the original game using id Tech 4, with an associated 2005 Doom motion picture. Another release, simply titled Doom and powered by id Tech 6, was released in 2016 and focused on returning to the fast-paced action of the first two games.</p>"

The game, released in 2007 is considered the first in the series.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The action takes place in the fictional Pacific City. The player is given control over the biologically improved Agent. The agent is the representative of the Agency, it was called to Pacific City because of the sudden increase in crime. The main task is to eliminate three criminal bosses and organized crime syndicates: Los Muertos, The Volk and Shai-Gen Corporation. In order to get to the very top and overthrow every villain, the player will have to travel around the city and defeat the first level of the criminal hierarchy: thieves and bandits. Each gang is assigned its own district - so capturing an offender in one area leads to the next level in the hierarchy of one of the gangs. Having defeated the kingpins the player can challenge the head of the criminal organization.</p>\n<h3>Game mechanics</h3>\n<p>The game is typical for the third-person-action set in a sandbox environment, like the games of the Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row series. Like other ones in the genre, Crackdown uses a huge set of cold weapons and firearms. As well as various skills and skills that you can upgrade: for example, for more distant jumps on the roofs, hijacking cars and studying the entire game world. For upgrading it is enough to accumulate the necessary amount of Experience Orbs. The entire territory of Pacific City is available for exploring right after the start of the game.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Pixel Piracy offers the player a role of a pirate captain. The game is designed in a very simplistic pixel-art style. Pixel Piracy plays with all sorts of jokes and comical stereotypes about pirates.</p>\n<h3>Setup</h3>\n<p>Before the game starts, the player has to choose the difficulty level and other options by answering questions about the game&#39;s world and its main character. Initially, the player only controls a single pirate, the would-be captain. The protagonist is partially customizable: the player can choose the character&#39;s look from several presets. As the game begins, the character has to build a ship and recruit a crew before they can set off to the sea. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The goal is to lead your crew to fame by defeating enemy pirates. Other than that, the player is free to explore the map, fight enemies to gain prestige points and upgrade the ship and the crew with new equipment. The pirates belong to various classes. A crew needs fighters to attack enemies, sailors to control the ship, a carpenter to fix it, and a cook to make food. </p>\n<h3>Genre</h3>\n<p>While Pixel Piracy is more of a strategy, there are some features of the roguelike genre. The world is procedurally generated, and the crew will randomly encounter feral beasts and hostile pirates from other gangs. The player has to keep track of the ship&#39;s resources, otherwise, the crew might die of starvation or lose its morale. As in the most roguelike games, the death of the main character is permanent, and he will not respawn if killed.</p>"

However, the player needs to defend his character\u2019s lair from daring adventurers. Knights set out on a quest of saving the beautiful princess,  and many more creatures with a common goal of defeating the dragon, which would be you. With level progression, players can upgrade different parameters of their scaled protagonist and improve their gold acquiring capabilities. <br />\nThe game offers four game modes, with cooperative multiplayer gradually increasing the difficulty and the overall fun of each playthrough. The graphics are unique in the way where the game field looks like a board game table, with castles and villages placed around differently each time, and the overall look of the game is as if it was a D&amp;D game that suddenly became alive.</p>"

To find parts for a broken ship and his faithful assistant Robot, Dick goes on a dangerous journey across an unknown planet. The game presents a very diverse set of weapons: ray guns, crystal swords, and laser whips. All devices in the game can be improved with the help of spare parts found on the levels.</p>\n<p>The game focuses on the movie style: in the settings, you can turn on the comments of the alleged director of the film. They are the link between the setting, the characters and the events that take place on the set. In addition to the story campaign, the game has a Survival mode, which is entirely independent. The player receives some gold and weapons and is surrounded by enemies in the arena. A full-fledged multiplayer is not here, but the game still can be played on one device in a cooperative mode.</p>"

Visually, the game is reminiscent of the game series of the era of 2D Worms 2: Armageddon and Worms Reloaded.</p>\n<p>For a single completion, there are 3x 18 holes courses all with its own visual style and challenges. As well as 15 challenges without complete courses. Also, there is multiplayer available for up to four players on the same device with the alternate right of turn. Worms can be customized to your taste. To do this, you must earn in-game cash to spend it on cosmetic items.</p>"

The current age of the action is called the Ninth World, as the characters believe it to be the successor of the past civilizations. The protagonist is the Last Castoff, an ancient man who left his physical body to reborn in a new one. He is a creation of the so-called Changing God. His actions attract the Sorrow, the antipode who tries to destroy the protagonist and other God\u2019s creations. To survive, the Last Castoff has to find his creator. The player aims to explore the Ninth World, find other creatures and confront the Sorrow. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player act from the Last Castoff perspective. He has the opportunity to perform in different ways; either peacefully \u2013 making arrangements with other characters, or hostilely \u2013 fighting with enemies and using power to negotiate. The setting is performed in the isometric perspective, and every performance is supported by the theme music and dialogues between the characters. </p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>Torment: Tides of Numenera is believed to be another game\u2019s spiritual successor. It is called Planescape: Torment which was developed in 1999. Just like in its predecessor, Torment places emphasis on the story rather than on combat or item accumulation.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Evoland 2 is an indie role-playing game developed by Shiro Games. It is the second installment in the Evoland series.</p>\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n<p>The players travel through four time periods which differ in their historical setting. The art style of each period matches 8-bit graphics, Nintendo&#39;s Game Boy graphics, 16-bit graphics, and finally 3D graphics. You play as Kuro, who sets out to the past to change the fate of humanity and the outcome of a war between the powerful demons. Players change the past in order to affect the present.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is fairly linear, but it opens up at some point of the story. The fighting system of the game consists of both real-time fights and turn-based battles. The players are free to explore the in-game world from a bird&#39;s view perspective. It is possible to search for collectibles that are placed in secret areas around the game&#39;s levels. </p>\n<p>The game pays tribute to numerous games. Most of these tributes are made during the game. While the main part of the game closely resembles the Legend of Zelda game series, the players will participate in a Street Fighter parody game or a sidequest mini-game that was inspired by Final Fantasy. </p>\n<p>There is a lot of humor present in the game. Sometimes the main characters will make remarks on the events happening around them and comment on the gameplay saying that it reminds them of some game they know about.</p>"

It is a direct sequel to the Oddworld: Abe&#39;s Oddysee.</p>\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n<p>The game is set in the Oddworld, a planet in another dimension, ten times larger than our Earth. Among its inhabitants, there&#39;s the race of Mudokons, a species of spiritual humanoids who can control others&#39; minds. Many Mudokons serve as the slaves to their more technically advanced enemies, Glukons. The protagonist is Abe, a blue-skinned Mudokon who escaped slavery and freed many of his compatriots.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game begins right after the ending of Oddworld: Abe&#39;s Oddysee. Abe learns that the evil Glukons use Mudokons as slaves in the Necrum Mines. The protagonist sets off on a quest to liberate the slaves. There, he discovers that Glukons&#39; popular drink called Soulstorm Brew is brewed from the bones and tears of the enslaved Mudokons. Abe&#39;s goal is to destroy the Soulstorm Brewery and to set his people free. The ending depends on the number of Mudokons the player saved.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Oddworld combines platforming with puzzles. Its levels consist of sections that occupy one screen each and require the player to overcome puzzles to move on. Abe cannot fight his enemies, but he can use his spiritual powers to defeat them, save Mudokons and advance through the levels. Abe&#39;s abilities include mind control, interacting with fellow Mudokons and limited telekinesis. To save Mudokons, Abe has to comfort them if they&#39;re angry or depressed. If he doesn&#39;t, they can harm others or themselves.</p>"

Originally the game was released in November 2011 for Windows and was free. Later the game appeared on Steam in the extended Deluxe edition, which included the original game, the soundtrack and the DLC of Teleporter Chambers.</p>\n<h3>Fast paced stealth</h3>\n<p>Each level of the game is a streak of obstacles, which requires the player to the accuracy of the pixel while moving forward in the shadow. The game has a dynamic lighting system, so it will not work staying long in one place. Developers have added this system in order to speed up the game process: they do like stealth games, but don\u2019t like their speed.</p>\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n<p>In the singleplayer campaign, there are 80 levels in eight worlds, tons of puzzles and enemies. The player in the arsenal has nothing but a pair of night vision goggles, so you have to rely solely on stealth to make your way through the levels. Clashing with enemies means instant death and start over from the very beginning. The dynamic light system completes the hardcore experience that is this game.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Hellion is a first person multiplayer space survival game.<br />\nIt is a fusion of survival and space simulation genres that pits players against the deadly environment and one another. Survive in the harsh conditions of space and scavenge for air, fuel and other items necessary for survival. But keep in mind, you are not the only one out there. There are others, but will they help, or will they throw you to the void without a second thought? Remember, no matter how brutal space may seem, it cannot hold a candle to man.<br />\nHellion is a solar system several thousand lightyears from Earth. Despite its distance, it is the target of the first interstellar colonization mission during the 23rd century. Almost a million colonists, suspended in cryogenic hibernation, leave Sol on a journey that would take many decades.<br />\nHowever, when they wake up, almost a century later, they find themselves trapped inside a nightmare. Instead of living in a manmade paradise, they are forced to fight for survival surrounded by deserted stations, incomplete orbital habitats and derelict warships.<br />\nWith the closest rescue operation decades away, orbital economy in disarray and no authorities in sight, many turn to scavenging, stealing and outright violence. Few others try to live more civilized and begin uncovering the truth behind the largest disaster in human history.<br />\nHellion is an ambitious project. It is an immersive world set in a solar system many lightyears from the comforts of Earth and is entirely based on the laws of Newtonian physics.<br />\nHellion will make its debut as an Early Access game.

        "description": "<p>Wakfu is a turn-based MMORPG developed by Ankama games. This is an indirect sequel to 2004 game Dofus. </p>\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n<p>The game takes places in the same universe as Dofus but in 1000 years after the events of the previous game. The player must defeat an ogre named \u201cOgrest\u201d which presumably made the world flood. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game follows a player-created avatar, which can choose one of eighteen classes available in the game. Each one has several unique abilities not available to other classes. Unlike other MMO RPGs, the player gets all of the classes\u2019 abilities from the start and can only strengthen them as they progress. After completing early sections of the game, the player can also join one of many in-game nations. The nations control parts of the world and are ruled by the real-player governor. The governor can appoint up to seven other players to run his administration. Each nation has its laws that can be changed by the governor. Players that break the law become outlaws and can be killed by other players without any penalty. <br />\nLike in other MMORPG, character progression depends on the experience they get. To get new levels, players can complete the quest, fight mobs and explore the dungeons. The combat in Wakfu is turn-based and incorporates some elements of tactical role-playing games.</p>"

The monsters differ in strength, health, speed, attacks, and abilities. Each player can advance by leveling up and getting new gear. Leveling up increases your stats and unlock new attacks and abilities. Spirits can also level up unlocking new monsters and objects to possess. The weapons and magical items can be found in the dungeon or bought from merchants. There are 25 types of weapons in the game that vary in stats and attack types.<br />\nAdditionally, each weapon can have one of 27 properties that can affect weapons damage, attack speed, give a chance to perform an elemental strike, or shot projectile. The maximum level in the game is ten after which the hero can face the dungeon boss. Other players must kill the hero by cooperatively controlling parts of the boss.</p>"

A dark power called Cadence repeatedly attacks the kingdom, corrupting everything it touches. There&#39;s a magic item called Massive Chalice that can purge the world of Cadence. However, the Chalice takes 300 years to recharge. The player&#39;s task is to hold on until the artifact reaches its full power. The Chalice has two souls that serve as the player&#39;s advisers.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player rules the kingdom using the world map in the Strategy mode and directly controls the units in the Tactical mode. The king himself does not appear as a unit. Instead, the player controls a group of champions with various skills and attributes. Some of the Cadence monsters that oppose the heroes have unusual attacks such as stealing the hero&#39;s XP points or aging the character.</p>\n<p>Since the player is immortal, the time is very compressed. The heroes eventually die of old age, which makes them disposable. The player has to breed new heroes and build dynasties by arranging marriages. There are three main classes of heroes: Caberjacks (heavy warriors), Hunters (ranged archers), and Alchemists (similar to wizards). Newborn heroes inherit their parents&#39; class, but if their parents are of different classes, they can learn certain skills from both. The heroes can also inherit artifacts that become stronger after being used by generations of ancestors.</p>"

The protagonist awakes on a shore with no memory of the events leading him here. He goes to Fort Henry which appears to be completely abandoned. The whole colony is actually abandoned, yet there are hostile beings whose bodies consist of burning embers. The protagonist goes on to seek answers about what actually happened in the colony.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Betrayer heavily relies on stealth in its gameplay. There are no clear paths or objective for the players to follow. This was made specifically to deprive the players of any sense of direction and encourage exploration of a monochrome game world. It is essential to listen to specific sounds in the game, as some of them will guide the players towards a clue or an important item. The clues are documented and put in your inventory upon picking them up. </p>\n<p>Upon encountering the enemies, the best strategy for the player is to hide in the high grass, spectate the enemy movement and pick the right moment to execute a stealth kill. Sound plays an important role here too, as any sound the players make in the grass will attract some unwanted attention, so it is essential to time your movement with the wind gusts. The players have access to a wide variety of weapons, such as pistols, muskets, tomahawks, and bows. Upon death, the players leave all their items at the place of death and can retrieve them.</p>"

The game&#39;s two campaign modes follow the two sides in the Crusades: the Crusaders and the Muslims. The game features historical figures like Saladin and Richard of England, as well as the characters from earlier games in the series, such as Rat and Wolf.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is similar to all Stronghold games. The player assumes the role of a medieval lord who controls his castle. The player has to build the walls and towers, hire the knights and archers, and establish a productive medieval economy to support the war effort. Most missions involve a siege of a castle, with the player as the attacker, the defender, or both.</p>\n<h3>Economy</h3>\n<p>Everything in Stronghold, from the food to the war, requires the player to establish a chain of production, such as a mill and a bakery to make bread. The player has to produce armor and weapons before hiring most types of units. There&#39;s also a reputation meter that tracks what the people think of their lord. The player can increase his or her reputation by offering the people more food, lowering taxes, or building pubs and churches.</p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>Stronghold Crusader II has several multiplayer modes. It was the first game in the series to introduce a cooperative mode that allows two players to control the same castle.</p>"

While the game is split into episodes that were released as separate titles, it has a single plot: Hector investigates the case that can be solved only with his unconventional methods.</p>\n<p>The story starts with Hector holding negotiations with a terrorist who took hostages. The sniper wants the protagonist to complete quests around the town. These missions are quite humorous and include such tasks as fixing the town clock and shutting down a pornography store. Because of such humor the game with 2D cartoonish graphics is not allowed for kids. </p>\n<p>Hector features point-and-click gameplay with a heavy focus on dialogues and less - on puzzle solving. Not all solutions in the game are obvious but, as a rule, you don\u2019t have many items to use so variations of your actions are quite limited. Another situation is with dialogues: choosing the right lines simplifies completing quests, as Hector can solve almost any problem talking to other characters in a suitable manner.</p>"

Major technological advancements happen, such as the perfection of cloning technology. This allowed for creating remote-controlled human clones. These clones are used in many aspects of everyday life. Several individuals that got fed up with the current oppressive government use the clones in order to kill the Overseer, who got holed up in his office in the building of a global corporation. Take control of the clones and eliminate the oppressor.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The levels of Neon Chrome are procedurally generated. The developers created an advanced physics model that allows for the environments to be completely destructible. </p>\n<p>If you die at some point in the game, you will have to start all over again. This makes the path to the Overseer a completely different experience every time you start over. </p>\n<p>There are many guns and cybernetic augmentations available to the players in the game. It is also possible to upgrade your character. At the beginning of the game, the players choose one of three roles to play. All three of them suit the cyberpunk universe of the game where giant corporations take over governments. </p>\n<p>The game comes bundled with a map and mod editor which allows for creating completely new experiences and sharing them with the game&#39;s community.</p>"

The game features Half-Life&#39;s trademark gritty industrial aesthetics and certain horror elements.</p>\n<h3>Premise</h3>\n<p>The player&#39;s character is armed with a new type of weapon, Zero Point Energy Projector. The device allows its user to perform incredibly high jumps and survive landing after seemingly fatal falls. To achieve this effects, the player has to fire the weapon down while in the air, essentially performing a rocket jump. The weapon&#39;s energy beams can also be used to eliminate obstacles and opponents. To let the player make more use of it, the creator made most of the environment destructible. There are also the traditional Half-Life enemies, such as zombies, headcrabs, and Combine Soldiers. The mod is single player only.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Transmissions: Element 120 is short and features a very little story. All narrative is delivered through action. It is only clear that game is set in the Half-Life universe, some time after the events of Half-Life 2: Episode Two. The nameless main character finds itself in an abandoned facility and has to fight his or her way out. There are diary pages and QR-codes scattered around the facility that provide cryptic messages and a little insight into the events. Some of them also serve as the clues to help the player to solve certain puzzles.</p>"

The player controls a group of one to four characters caught in the middle of a war. Each protagonist has a unique set of abilities and weaknesses, some of which are hidden. Their goal is to simply stay alive. It requires them to scavenge food, meds, and other necessary supplies, keep their house warm during the winter and avoid the military. </p>\n<p>By day, the city of Pogoren is filled with snipers who shoot at everyone indiscriminately. The player can explore the city only by night, though it is not safe either, as the characters can encounter hostile looters and marauders. Survival also requires crafting new items from the scavenged junk. One of the most useful items to build is the radio that allows the player to keep track of the events outside. To win the game, the characters have to survive until peacetime which may come at random times.</p>\n<h3>Expansion features</h3>\n<p>The Little Ones expansion pack allows the player to include a child in the group of survivors. It adds a new layer of complexity to the gameplay. The child is helpless and needs an adult to take care of him or her. However, the kid can eventually learn to perform simple tasks, such as cooking. To avoid depression, the child has to assemble new toys from the junk the adults have scavenged and meet other kids to play.</p>"

Players are invited to take the place of Naija, ocean dweller, resembling a human woman with fish-like features, which allow her to swim and breathe underwater. Naija has lost most of her memories and has to explore the world outside, and is up to players to guide her towards the center of the mystery of her origin, the creation of Aquaria and the world outside, wherein the centers of ruined civilizations ancient gods are resting. <br />\nThe gameplay centers on the inability to directly interact with objects or items, but through the system of short musical tunes. In the default form, Naija can summon a circle, with eight positions to fill with differently colored notes. Surroundings will be affected by the notes of the corresponding color, and once players learn more complicated melodies after unlocking through the story will not only help to lift objects and to create a protective shield but change forms as well. A total of seven forms are available by the end of the game, some of which are used to go through the story barriers.</p>"

Set in the Cold War, the player controls a spy that infiltrates the military bases of rival countries. </p>\n<p>The game is a 2.5D side-scroller but the players are able to target their weapons in a three-dimensional space. The main objective is to prevent the enemy from launching nuclear missiles. The players have to be cautious as getting detected affects the DEFCON status of a country in which the player is at the moment. If the player gets detected too often, the country enforces DEFCON 1 and launches uses its nuclear weaponry. The players can abort the launch if they make it in time, which results in completion of the level. </p>\n<p>Throughout the levels, the players can collect intelligence, which serves as an in-game currency. Intel is spent to buy ammo, upgrade your weapons or buy new ones.</p>"

Rogue machines are about to wipe out a city of 12 million people. The defenders have only 50 days left to prepare before the final battle begins. The protagonist is a pilot who drives Exos, the game&#39;s equivalent of mechas.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls a group of four Exos. Their movements and attacks are turn-based. During the 50-days period, the player has to gather details and HPs to upgrade his or her Exos, explore the map, prepare defenses, and set traps. On the final day, the player&#39;s preparations will be tested by the enemy invasion. Preparation is everything in this game. Stealth and tactical use of the environment are also important since Exos often cannot withstand against a horde of enemies in an open battle.</p>\n<h3>Difficulty</h3>\n<p>Like many roguelike games, Bionic Dues is unforgiving. It uses trial and error gameplay model so that the player usually has to fail many times before he or she can succeed. However, there are six difficulty levels that make it more tolerable for less experienced players.</p>\n<h3>Visual style</h3>\n<p>Bionic Dues&#39; visuals are minimalistic, cold and &quot;robotic&quot;, complete with &quot;mechanical&quot; voices and high-tech unit design. It presents the player with a top-down view of the map that looks almost like a circuit board.</p>"

The plot begins in prehistoric times when people&#39;s writing was petroglyphic and reaches our times when the world is captured by pixelated nostalgia.</p>\n<p>There are ten worlds in total, which are associated with specific periods in the history of typography development. Each level is backed by a ton of documents and historical references, which reveal the context even wider. The developers did not make the game too complicated - its task is enlightening, and it should reach to the broader audience. All riddles are built on physics of game objects.</p>\n<p>One of the main puzzles is the controls. It is unusual and sometimes difficult to master. The game was praised by critics as one of the most innovative, offering the original concept. Available on mobile devices, consoles from Sony and on PC.</p>"

It is also possible to earn new sniper rifle upgrades such as extended magazine capacity or fire rate increase.</p>\n<p>The game was initially released as a pre-order bonus but as of 2018, it comes bundled with an Elite edition of Hitman: Absolution.</p>"

It has very few differences from its predecessor, the original Anomaly: Warzone Earth.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Anomaly Korea takes place in the future, after an alien attack that devastated much of the Earth. The invaders landed their ships on our planet and are protect them with heavy fortifications. The player assumes the role of a commander of an armored squad that tries to penetrate the alien defenses. As its name suggests, this installment of the series is set in Korea.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay didn&#39;t change much since the previous Anomaly installment. The player controls a group of armored units in real time. The number of units is limited, and there are no options to produce more, so the player has to keep his or her units safe. There is a limited number of boosts the player can use to improve a unit&#39;s health or attacks. </p>\n<p>Anomaly Korea includes twelve levels in its campaign mode. The primary goal of each level is usually to eliminate the defense towers that protect the alien base. One of the few notable improvements in Korea, besides better graphics, is the variety of its missions. They can include objectives like destroying a specific number of enemy towers or protecting a peaceful convoy on an escort mission. The game also introduces a new mode called Art of War that offers the player a set of more difficult missions.</p>"

It was first shown in 1998 together with the first game of the series. The fourth part of the game uses version 2.5 and is the sequel to Unreal Tournament 2003.</p>\n<h3>The story</h3>\n<p>Famous designer Cliff Bleszinski led the team of developers on this one. He is known for such games as Jack The Jazz Rabbit and Gears of War. The game takes place in a fictional universe where people are involved in an endless war with aliens named Skaarj. For the moral support of the colonists, who need to restore their home planet, the Liandri Corporation came up with a gladiatorial tournament where miners compete with each other. The action of Unreal Tournament 2004 begins in the tenth anniversary year, in which the Skaarj Empire sent its representatives to participate.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>Gameplay-wise game is a first-person shooter, with the ability to participate in single battles and in multiplayer matches. The game has more than a hundred maps and ten game modes, which at the time when the game was released made it almost the most massive of all online shooters. Vehicles also appeared in UT2004, - to get around huge open maps.</p>"

You play as Hector, a police officer, permanently drunk and doesn\u2019t fit the description of a \u201cgood cop\u201d. However, this time the police needs Hector\u2019s help because only he can calm down a very nervous sniper.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to hold a successful negotiation with a terrorist who keeps hostages and kills passers-by. The story is based on a series of quests. There aren\u2019t many environmental puzzles while some decisions are not quite clear; instead, the game focuses on dialogues. Choosing the right lines can lead you to solving multiple issues and simplify your way to the goal. </p>\n<p>The game is created in 2D cartoonish style but it\u2019s restricted for kids. Hector is full of dirty humor and controversial situations. This tone is kept in other two episodes subtitled Senseless Acts of Justice and Beyond Reasonable Doom.</p>"

As the game starts, the player fetches fire daggers.<br />\nThen he is transported to the dark arena, where monsters begin to spawn. The goal is to fight off every appearing enemy. More exotic creatures appear throughout the game; later on, the player can recognize the type of a monster based on the unique noise one makes. There are two alternatives in using the daggers: the protagonist can either fire a shotgun-like blast with a widespread (the player clicks the left mouse button) or fire a continuous stream of them (the player holds the mouse button). The player can die if he touches an enemy, or if he falls off the stage. After that the player can fetch the red crystals dropping from the top of the screen \u2013 it lets them upgrade the daggers. </p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The game design uses distorted effects like texture warping and polygon jitter. That makes it look like an old shooter game from the 1990s.</p>"

The player controls an aphid grub during the process of metamorphosis. The game lets the player explore familiar environments from the insect\u2019s perspective. Morphopolis is completely hand-drawn, uses bright colors and contrast pallet. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay is very reminiscent of other point-and0click adventures. The developer mentions Machinarium and Tiny Bang Story as the main sources of inspiration.<br />\nThe primary goal of the game is to achieve the spawning ground. To do so, you must travel to various locations like gardens and fields. Each level consists of two parts. First, you have to find several items on the screen, such as eggs, flowers, parts of other insects. Then you solve a quick puzzle a get another list of items that you have to collect. <br />\nThe gameplay itself, however, is not the focal point of Morphopolis, but rather a reason to explore unique environments. The game is centered on its art-style and unusual setting, making it mostly an aesthetic experience.</p>"

The player controls Pac-Man through the maze where he must eat dots and avoid hostile ghosts. Besides dots, the player can collect bonus items that give additional points, and power pellets that allow Pac-Man to eat ghosts. Eating several ghosts in a row triggers a combo that gives the player a huge amount of extra points. <br />\nThough the base gameplay is similar to that of the original arcade game, there are numerous new mechanics and gameplay differences in Championship Edition DX. The mazes consist of two halves. Eating all the dots on one of them makes a bonus item appear on the other half and eating an item makes a new dots layout appear on the other side. If a ghost is about to catch Pac-Man, a slow-motion effect kicks in giving the player an opportunity to avoid it. <br />\nThere are three main game modes in the game: Score Attack, Time Attack, and Ghost Combo. The game features nine different courses and several visual style options. </p>\n<h3>DX+ version</h3>\n<p>In 2013, the game was renamed as PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+ and received a free update. It featured an upgrade to the online component of the game and new paid downloadable content such as new skins and courses.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Hector Episode 2, subtitled Senseless Acts of Justice, is the second chapter of a three-part episodic adventure game. It was released as a standalone title, and directly follows the events of its predecessor, Episode 1 - We Negotiate With Terrorists. You take on the role of Detective Hector - a constantly drunk police officer that investigates the case other cops can\u2019t solve. The game features tough humor and adult language.</p>\n<p>The game starts as Hector survives the sniper\u2019s shot and the explosion of the building. Together with his assistant Lambert Hector starts the investigation that must lead him to the crime\u2019s mastermind. You need to collect the evidence and punish the organization responsible for the explosion.</p>\n<p>As a classic point-and-click graphic adventure, Hector is heavily focused on dialogues with NPCs and puzzle solving. However, in this game talk is more significant than your ability to match things together collecting the clues. Some issues can be solved if you convince your opponent to perform a certain action by choosing the right lines in dialogues.</p>"

        "description": "<p>The Forgotten City is a game about time travel, a mysterious murder, and avoiding fate. It is based on an award-winning Skyrim mode of the same name. The game retains most of the original mod&#39;s lore, but reimagines the characters and the setting and features a completely new voice acting and a music score. The game is powered by Unreal Engine.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game is set in a mythological ancient Roman city somewhere deep underground. A group of 26 archeologists explored the city until one of them accidentally broke a taboo and activated an ancient curse. Now they are trapped in a time loop and cursed to die and relive their deaths forever. That is, unless one of them changes what happened to the city and its inhabitants long ago, thus preventing the curse.  In the ruins, there&#39;s a portal, which leads to the past and allows the characters to relive and alter the previous events in the vein of The Groundhog Day movie. The Forgotten City features branching non-linear plots with difficult moral dilemmas and plot twists. There are multiple endings that depend on the player&#39;s actions.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls a protagonist that is fully customizable, up to his or her sex and physical appearance, in a 3D ancient city. Compared to the original mod, the game introduces new combat mechanics and wall climbing. However, most of the gameplay is based around characters&#39; interactions and timeline manipulations.</p>"

Since then, the Bad Company has been fighting not only for the victory and glory of its country, but also for the sake of gold, which can be obtained in the pockets of defeated opponents.</p>\n<h3>The Newby and the Team</h3>\n<p>Preston Marlowe is the main protagonist of the game. He just came to the Bad Company - just before the Bad Company found a new goal for itself - gold.</p>\n<p>Sergeant Samuel D. Redford is the commander of the Bad Company and the only one who came there as a volunteer. He just likes to fight.</p>\n<p>George Gordon Haggard, Jr. - has an explosive nature. And he knows everything about explosives.<br />\nTerrence Sweetwater - smart ass.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player acts with one main weapon and another, used in the second turn. In addition to this, there are grenades, a knife and portable explosive devices. The player always has information about the number of remaining ammunition. If vehicles are not completely destroyed, they can be repaired any number of times. </p>\n<p>Military vehicles in the game are sufficient: infantry fighting vehicles, armored cars, tanks, attack helicopters, patrol boats, mobile anti-aircraft weapon system.</p>\n<p>For the first time in the Battlefield games line, the Frostbite game engine is used - 90% of the environment can be destroyed. Destruction is subject to almost everything: trees, grass and bushes, vehicles, other players and even the ground itself. Lighting is adjusted for changes caused by destruction.</p>\n<h3>More and more</h3>\n<p>Gold Edition<br />\nThe main feature of this edition is that it immediately makes available those types of weapons that are usually unlocked after reaching level 25.</p>\n<p>Find All Five<br />\nThis addition allows you to unlock five types of weapons that are not available in the main game - the F2000 machine, the USAS-12 automatic shotgun, the M60 machine gun, the QBU-88 sniper rifle and the Uzi submachine gun with the silencer. For this purpose, special codes are given on the official website of the game.</p>\n<p>Community Choice Map Pack<br />\nThis is a set of four new maps for the &quot;Conquest&quot; mode.</p>\n<p>Battlefield: Bad Company 2<br />\nA direct sequel.</p>"

        "description": "<p>In Gish, the player can assume the role of a piece of tar. The game is similar to physics-based platformers like LocoRoco.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The backstory of Gish is a parody of the video game cliches. Gish is a jelly yet sentient black creature who lives underground. Gish&#39;s love interest Brea, a human female, was kidnapped by his jealous ex-classmate. Gish goes on a quest to rescue Brea. Defeating the final boss does not automatically save Brea. The player can fail, and the game will end nonetheless, leading to a darker ending.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Gish and navigates him through the levels. Gish has no legs or other organs besides a mouth and two eyes, but he has several useful abilities. He can change his shape and physical state to suit the player&#39;s needs. Gish can become amorphous to slip down the slopes and squeeze through the thinnest gaps and holes. He can stick to the walls, ceilings, and other surfaces to climb and hold on. Gish can also become a solid ball which allows him to push other objects from his way, break the obstacles and crush opponents with his weight. Puzzle-like level design often requires Gish to use a complex combination of his powers.</p>\n<h3>Style</h3>\n<p>The game is made in a simple and cartoonish visual style and has occasional glimpses of black humor. It is mostly set underground, in the dark tunnels and caverns. Gish is accompanied by a rock soundtrack that suits the game&#39;s quirky and creepy atmosphere.</p>"

The battles, as the name implies, lack any backstory whatsoever, as the game presents them as different skirmish maps. Different surroundings and different fleet compositions help achieve victory, but the enemy also uses environmental hazards as the means of preventing the player from winning. The battlefield is non-interactable, which means the player has to plan each movement.<br />\nThe game features a multiplayer mode, where players can battle each other using their customized ships, with different upgrades allowing to gain an edge over the enemy. The stunning 2D graphics ensure that the look of each ship type is unique and memorable, and the battle itself shines with colorful explosions, laser beams everywhere and almost realistic crashes of defeated spacecraft.</p>"

She is put in the Blackgate prison with the help of Batman. Two weeks later, the prisoners attempt an escape. The prison&#39;s staff is taken hostage, and the security detail is dead. Catwoman agrees to help Batman save the hostages.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Unlike the Arkham game series, Blackgate is a 2.5-dimensional game, like Metroid and Castlevania. However, the game does not use any features of such dimension and plays out like a usual 2D title. </p>\n<p>The Protagonist walks from right to left clearing the prison out, saving the staff, and completing side-quests like finding items. Items can be detected using Batman&#39;s Detective Vision. </p>\n<p>When Batman walks into a new area of the prison, there a chance of encountering a group of prisoners, which will attack him. All the enemies, apart from bosses, require two or three hits to be knocked out. Most of the game&#39;s fights can be avoided by using stealth. When the player clears a certain area of the prison out, it will remain clear of enemies until the end of the game.</p>"

The game features a class system - at the beginning of the match, you choose a character each of which has unique combat and tactical skills.</p>\n<h3>Characters</h3>\n<p>Block N Load features 12 characters which differ in their gameplay. For example, Sarge is a tank-type character, who pushes his enemies head-on to deal the most amount of damage possible, while Juan Shinobi is a stealth-based character that relies on his fast movement and teleportation skills to get behind his enemies, slice them up, and vanish.</p>\n<p>Each character is capable of building up defenses and is equipped with a shovel.

        "description": "<p>Secret World Legends is a reboot of the 2012 MMO game The Secret World. Unlike the original game, the reboot is free-to-play.</p>\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n<p>The game is set in a low fantasy world that was inspired by the works of horror authors like Stephen King and Howard Lovecraft, as well as Indiana Jones movie series. The setting combines the background of our real world with elements of mythology, urban legends and conspiracy theories that became true. The locations in the game include real-world cities as well as fictional places. They are mostly set in the big urban areas, depicted as dark, gloomy places fit for gothic stories.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The players&#39; characters receive magical powers and learn that the End of Days is at hand. They have to participate in a war against evil and fight demons, vampires, and other monsters, as well as dark cultists who worship evil gods. They are forced to join one of the three main factions in the game: the Illuminati, the Templars, or the Dragon. They will have to travel to many places, such as Transylvania and Egypt, and even back in time.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player can choose the first person or third person view. There are no character classes, and the player can freely change the character&#39;s abilities during the game. The player can also obtain a new weapon, but it costs either a microtransaction or an amount of in-game money.</p>"

The game revolves around slaying hordes of enemies, killing bosses, acquiring points and unlocking new abilities. There are four players to choose from Barbarian, Valkyrie, Elf, and Wizard. Each of them has the unique set of weapons and abilities. The Barbarian is the strongest melee fighter in the game; Valkyrie has a shield and spear that allow her to pierce enemies from a distance, Elf can shoot arrows and throw bomb and Wizard can combine three elements to create different spells. <br />\nThe game heavily relies on multiplayer. Up to four players can play cooperatively. Playing with other people requires coordination since some of the players\u2019 abilities can hurt other players. Besides, all the loot and extra items in dungeons, such as food that recovers the characters\u2019 HP, accrue to the first player that collects it. </p>\n<h3>Slayer Edition</h3>\n<p>The game was initially released only for PC. In 2015, it received an updated PlayStation 4 port with Slayer Edition subtitle. The update brought a new \u201cEndless\u201d game mode, new weapons and abilities, and some gameplay tweaks such as increased difficulty and replacement of the in-game shop with loadout system.

The players have to deliver cargo using the post-Soviet machinery deep in the Russian woods, where there are no solid roads and a lot of fallen trees.</p>\n<p>The main feature of the game is dynamic terrain. That is achieved with Havok physics engine. Trucks leave marks on the road, get stuck in the terrain, which makes the further advancement harder.  Thanks to Havok, the terrain is procedurally generated every time the player loads a map. That adds a high replayability value to the game. This feature also makes the races against other players much harder, as you can&#39;t just win a race by going as fast as you can.</p>\n<p>In SPINTIRES, the game focuses a lot on simulating the physics and behavior of the vehicles. Every machine has a limited amount of gas, can be damaged beyond any repair. The players can turn the differential lock on or off, activate the 4X4 mode, which will influence the amount of used gas. It is also possible to drag the car out of the mud by using a rope and attaching it to a tree or another car.</p>\n<p>The players can also modify the cars using different attachments. It is possible to attach fuel tanks, repair kits, and so on.</p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>The game features a 4-player multiplayer mode, where the players can choose the time of day, and the environment. The objective of the mode is to reach the finish first without getting stuck in the mud.</p>"

It is set in the cold, rainy area during autumn and winter. Uncanny Valley features dark, claustrophobic levels and is set to creepy horror synth / dark ambient music.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The plot of Uncanny Valley is nonlinear and strongly depends on the player&#39;s choices. The game itself recommends the player to replay it several times to discover all possible plotlines and endings.</p>\n<p>The protagonist is Tom, a security guard at a secret facility. His only colleagues are Buck, an obese guard, and Eve, a young caretaker who is Tom&#39;s love interest. His mental health is far from perfect, as Tom suffers from narcolepsy. He often falls asleep and loses the edge between reality and fantasy. Some of the events in the game are actually the main character&#39;s illusions and dreams.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player leads Tom as he does his daily watchman&#39;s job. By night, he has to patrol the secret research facility, eventually learning its dark secrets. Occasionally, Tom will fall into his nightmares and have to run away from the shadowy enemies. Tom cannot sprint for too long before his stamina runs out. However, in Uncanny Valley, the protagonist cannot die and there are no Game Overs.</p>"

And for the game that is a direct sequel to 2008 free to play the flash game mostly created by one man, it is a no small feat. <br />\nPlayers will have to lead the nameless protagonist to battle against enemy war corporation on the distant ice-covered planet. Sci-fi style of the setting creates an opportunity to present a lot of unique mecha-enemies, whose behavior is based on physics and procedural animation, which results in ragdoll physics for the 2D sprites. Intrusion 2 is a relatively short game that has only nine levels. And in order to compensate, the stages are scaled and filled with enemies to represent an old-school gauntlet-like experience. Some of the enemies can be mounted, giving the players some extra mobility. At the end of every three levels players will have to go through a multistage boss battle, and with every difficulty level the game will ramp up the number of enemies and threats on the hard mode.</p>"

Conrad is a mechanic on the Leopold spacecraft. In space, the ship is faced with a huge unknown ship, inhabited by hostile creatures. These creatures sneak aboard the Leopold and begin to destroy the crew.</p>\n<p>Konrad fights to save his life and the ship.</p>\n<p>He is helped by the female android MIA, she gives advice, helps to find the right items.</p>\n<p>The action takes place both on the &quot;Leopold&quot; and on a hostile ship.</p>\n<p>Alien Breed 2: Assault</p>\n<p>The game begins where the history of the previous game ended. The hero of this game is the same Theodor J. Conrad, but his ship Leopold is already critically damaged and impossible to save.</p>\n<p>MIA is still trying to help Conrad, but becomes a victim of Klein - a man who managed to load his intellect into a computer that controls the alien ship. When trying to influence this computer, MIA fell under the influence of Klein&#39;s intellect and now cannot help Theodor.</p>\n<p>Klein tells Theodor that the ship was not really created by aliens, but by the inhabitants of Earth and is a huge scientific station, where earthlings explored alien beings.</p>\n<p>Alien Breed 3: Descent</p>\n<p>Theodor&#39;s situation becomes even more complex. Now the only one with whom Theodor can communicate is Klein&#39;s intellect, loaded into a computer. However, this is quite a developed &quot;creature&quot; that fully controls the ship, or rather, the scientific station, along with all the aliens on it. And this intelligence is able not only to control the aliens, but also to modify them.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, Klein is able to send against Theodor his last ally MIA - MIA did not die, but turned into a fully manipulated Klein artificial intelligence, opposed to Theodor. However, Theodor manages to win over her and she even tells him how to defeat Klein. This is not easy, because Klein directs against Theodor all the systems of a huge ship.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay has common features in all three games of the series.</p>\n<p>All games are shooters, the action of which takes place in the futuristic interiors of space ships.</p>\n<p>Each level contains several tasks, such as finding keys or restoring ship systems to work.</p>\n<p>Before leaving the level, the player must complete all tasks.</p>\n<p>Opponents are aliens.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, you can save the game only in special places. The same places serve as shops where upgrades and other useful things can be purchased.</p>\n<p>Information about opponents is revealed as the hero finds relevant sources of information in the game space.</p>"

The owner of the St. George Cross, Violetta successfully fulfilled the tasks of the British special services. She was caught and killed in a concentration camp during the war. The player will go on a stealth adventure in the era of World War II and take control of Violette Summer, which runs deep behind enemy lines.</p>\n<h3>the story</h3>\n<p>The story tells of a girl from Dorset, Violette Summer, who lived happily with her family. But the war was all the same, and in the darkest times for the country, Violette joins the secret services of Britain. The game consists of secret missions and sabotages in which she took part. The action takes place in war-torn Europe: the agent is operating in Poland, Germany, and France.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>From gameplay the point of view, the game is practically no different from other representatives of the genre: from the very beginning, Violette will have to hide in the shadows in order to survive and move through levels. The user interface helps the player to navigate in terms of how visible his/her actions are: it shows the silhouette of Violette, which can be in three states - each one representing how well the agent is hidden. The game does not provide a complex combat system, but the ability to detect a rebuff to enemies is available. Also, players can upgrade agent\u2019s skills on three branches: Stealth, Morphine or Strength.</p>"

You control one of several characters most of which are animal weapons from the previous Worms games.<br />\nYour character sits in a boat floating on water and has to clean the playfield from multicolored hexagons hanging on the top. To do so, you can use a variety of weapons, including the iconic Worms\u2019 bazooka, grenades, dynamite sticks, shotgun and many more. With every shot, the weapon changes its color. Shooting blocks of the same color make them along with all color matched blocks connected disappear. If the block is a different color from the weapon, the block gets recolored. </p>\n<h3>Game modes</h3>\n<p>There are three single-player modes: Puzzle, Tournament, vs. CPU; and eight multiplayer modes: Deathmatch, Don\u2019t Drop Em, Star Collection, Tide Trial, One Line For Two, Star Race, Survival and Fight. In multiplayer, the playfield is divided into two separate parts for each player.<br />\nThe barrier between them periodically opens, allowing the player to shoot each other. The puzzle mode consists of 60 levels with different challenges. Completing them unlocks new characters. Each character in the game has its unique characteristics.</p>"

The game is divided into sixteen levels.<br />\nThe player must get through each of them slaying hordes of enemies. Most of the levels consist of the arena-like room where you have to defeat waves of monsters to progress. Some levels end up with battles against huge Bosses that require player shoot specific parts of their bodies. The game takes place in different areas of purgatory. Some of them resemble specific historical settings like ancient Rome, ancient Egypt or medieval Japan. Completing specific tasks awards player with tarot-cards that give Belial special powers. <br />\nThe Belial\u2019s weaponry is different from that of Daniel through most of the weapons are similar in mechanics to their counterparts from the original game. Every weapon has at least two firing modes. For example, Bonegun can act like a typical shotgun or turn enemies into stone; razor cube can rotate metal projectiles at high speed, draw enemies to Belial or slowly shoot metal projectiles.</p>"

Now blood flowed freely in Akalabeth, and foul creatures soon came to roam near the surface. Mondain cast such sickness and pestilence upon Akalabeth, that both man and beast lived in constant fear. Thus was the Dark Age of Akalabeth.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThere arose from the land a man, pure and just, to battle the Dark Lord. British, Champion of the White Light, did battle with Mondain deep within the labyrinth of dungeons, eventually driving him from Akalabeth forever. British of the White Light was proclaimed Lord British, Protector of Akalabeth. Alas, much damage had been suffered unto the lands. The Revival of Akalabest has begun. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n'Tis thy duty to rid Akalabeth of the foul creatures which infest it, whilst trying to stay alive!Developed in 1979, Akalabeth is the first game made by the legendary creator of the Ultima Series, Richard Garriot. \r\nDesigned by the teenage Garriot in Applesoft BASIC for the Apple II, Akalabeth is one of the earliest known examples of a computer role-playing game, and is considered by many to be \"Ultima 0.\" \r\nFeaturing 10 different monsters, procedurally generated dungeon crawling, and wire frame 3D graphics, Akalabeth was highly advanced for its time and is still widely regarded as one of the most historically significant RPGs ever created."

        "description": "<p>Pinball FX 2 is a traditional pinball game with a lot of adjustable options and an online multiplayer.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The basic rules of the game are exactly the same as for any pinball simulator. The player launches the ball to a diagonal table and watches as it randomly bounces back and forth. The player can only control the flippers in the lower part of the screen and uses them to prevent the ball from falling off the table. The goal is to hit certain elements with the ball to achieve a higher score before the ball falls off. Different tables have different layouts and may introduce additional rules, such as a player losing part of the score every time he or she loses the ball.</p>\n<h3>Tables</h3>\n<p>There are more than 70 tables in Pinball FX 2. Some of them are available from the start, and some can be downloaded for free, while others the player has to purchase. Each table has a theme to its design, such as Biolab, Buccaneer, or a popular franchise like Alien or Star Wars.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s Operators menu that lets the player customize any table he or she owns. Customization includes allocation of table elements and special rules. For example, the player can adjust certain elements to appear only after a certain amount of points is gained.</p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>Pinball FX 2 includes several multiplayer options, both online and local. In the local mode, the players use the split screen. To win in the multiplayer mode, a player has to score a specified amount of points before his or her rival.</p>"

The slogan of the game \u201cWhat happens when the DLC practices go too far?\u201d describes the main concept: there are more than 30 different DLC in the game, which open access to such things as character animation, the ability to move and so on. Each mechanic and every function that is considered a basic in an ordinary game here is hidden by an independent developer under the lock of additional content, which must be bought for the coins collected in the game. Perhaps the industry has gone too far in pursuit of profit and has forgotten what games are in the first place? The developer is trying to answer this question through the monotonous grind for abilities and power-ups.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The player takes control of the nameless protagonist, who must save the princess. The stereotypical story serves as the glue for a set of levels classics to the genre. The genre was selected suitably for such plot: DLC Quest is a 2D platformer. The game has two full story campaign: the original story of DLC Quest and the addition of Live Freemium or Die. Also, more than twenty achievements are available and an online leaderboard for comparing results with friends.</p>"

It\u2019s Flashback re-imagined. The original Core-Team revamped their own creation, leveraging the best of today\u2019s technology while remaining true to the classic side-scroller that set the standards of the genre in the 90\u2019s.Key Features<br />\nOne of the best adventure-action games ever created re-imagined by its creators. It\u2019s the same team. It\u2019s the same passion. Only this time, they have had much more firepower at their disposal to recreate the legendary classic!<br />\nGorgeous graphics, amazing animations. It\u2019s the Flashback you\u2019ve always dreamed of. True to the original spirit but made a million times better by using modern engines such as Unreal and Havok. The makeover is completely stunning.<br />\nIt\u2019s all about Gameplay. The team modernized gameplay mechanics, making the game more reactive, offering new features, like gadgets and an experience progression system. But the developers kept the original formula in mind: a fine balance between rolling and shooting, exploring remote space stations and obliterating hostile alien planets.<br />\nBringing back new memories. The story was revamped to speak to 21st century gamers. Most of the cast of the original game is still here \u2013 Conrad, the Morphs \u2013 but you can expect new characters and a few twists you\u2019re definitely not going to forget\u2026 this time.</p>"

They crash land in unknown environments, and Arid\u2019s goal is to save her pilot and restore his health. Being AI, Arid follows strict rules such as not to endanger pilot or not to deceive. The boundaries of AI will is one of the main themes in the game\u2019s story. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game revolves around exploring environments, solving puzzles and sporadic fighting with different enemies. The gameplay incorporates elements of Metroidvania and point-and-click adventures. Some areas in the game require special items to access that can be found in other parts of the game world. One of the most notable gameplay mechanics in The Fall is that flashlight serves as a pointer. You have to highlight the items to interact with them. <br />\nDuring combat, your flashlight turns into a laser sight. The player can use covers or blend into the background using camouflage. The enemies usually do not need many hits to kill the player. So most of the time landing accurate headshots is the best tactics to defeat enemies. The player can also perform stealth attacks that recover the main hero\u2019s health.</p>"

In the face of the destruction of an entire civilization and life on the planet, warring parties decided to call a truce and tried to repair the damage. For that, however, was already too late. Using all the remaining magic resources to cast a powerful spell, they managed to keep their world in a relative balance. <br/><br/>Many dark ages have passed, but when all seemed lost, a spark of hope shined once again: new sources of magic appeared and the whole planet began to give birth to new mages. Now, the rediscovered power can either restore Driftland to its former glory or devastate what's left of the planet, when the old conflict inevitably returns.<br/><br/>You take the role of a Mage Overlord with your own castle, tower, and a small realm on one of the islands.

The player has to investigate several cases, that do not appear to be linked between each other at first playing as Sherlock Holmes himself and his sidekick Doctor Watson. The player has to decide for himself who Sherlock actually is - a friend, a savior, a genius detective or an unusually witted law offender.</p>\n<h3>Characters</h3>\n<p>The main characters in the game are Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. Frogwares continues to follow their tradition of using their own portrayal of the protagonists, however, this time their appearance was reworked, as the protagonists now appear to be much younger.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay revolves around arriving at the crime scene, examining the scene, finding clues (several items are used to help the players, such as a magnifying glass), talking to different characters, witnesses, interrogating the suspects and interacting with items. The players often have to make assumptions in a mini-game that simulates the deductive method that Holmes uses.</p>\n<p>The game features both the third-person camera, that is used by default and the first-person one. The players are free to choose whichever one they like at any time.</p>"

All races take place in a generic city at night called Olympic City, though the city bears some resemblance to New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

The game is a part of America\u2019s Army series. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The player performs as an infantryman, a part of a Long Range Combined Arms \u2013 Recon unit. The plot is based on the U.S. intervention in the Ostregal Islands as a call for defending the RDO Government which was struck by the Czervenians. The U.S. forces landed on the Islands to engage in police action and reconnaissance operations. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>This is a classic first eye tactical shooter. The player is given certain tasks to perform as a part of the unit.<br />\nThe aim is to stay alive in campaigns and fulfill each task. It is possible to change the character\u2019s appearance even though the customization system is quite small. There are a few weapons including M4, M16, standard sniper rifle and shotgun. Maps are not too huge which makes it easier to go through a match. The maps vary in landscapes and size. Each one provides its benefits: it is possible to hide behind the trees in the forest mode or hole upon the earth in the field. The player is free to choose the very own tactics, be it the perfect stealth, merging in the terrain, or be it the classic get-through shooting campaign. The gameplay includes medical help; if the player is injured, it is possible to bandage yourself or wait for help.</p>"

        "description": "<p>ARMA: Gold Edition is a first-person tactical military shooter simulator developed by Bohemia Interactive Studio. Gold Edition includes the expansion pack named Queen&#39;s Gambit. </p>\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n<p>A fictional island of Sahrani is divided into two parts: a communistic north and a democracy established in the south. The U.S. armed forces that participated in training in the southern part of the island prepare for their leave. This moment is used by the northern communistic dictator for the invasion. The player controls a private that hadn&#39;t left the island prior to the conflict. Your squad will assist the local resistance in repelling the attacks while awaiting reinforcements from the mainland.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The players complete linear missions which feature both main and side objectives. There is an illusion that the game is not linear at all and that the player directly affects the outcome of the war.</p>\n<p>The game puts a strong emphasis on realism. The game features realistic weapons, vehicles, ballistics, animations, character damage, and the world&#39;s landscapes. There are no health points in the game. The players can get killed with 1-2 shots unless they wear body armor or heal their wounds in time.</p>\n<p>The game came bundled with a level editor which gave birth to a dedicated community and allowed for the creation of countless custom scenarios and levels.</p>\n<p>The game features a multiplayer mode in which other players can drop into your game seamlessly and either play with or against you.</p>"

        "description": "<p>The Howler is an indie puzzle platformer game developed by Antanas Marcelionis. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The plot of the game is based on the Lithuanian novel Hour of the Wolf. It is set in an alternate version of the 20th century Lithuania. The Alliance of Free Cities was created by the Rothschilds. Alchemists perform their research, and inventors fly their steampunk airships, mechanics create robotics. The story follows a former United States Marine Antanas Sidabras, who lives in the Free City Of Vilnius and investigates a murder. A major conspiracy comes up during his investigation.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Antanas Marcelionis was the illustrator of Hour of the Wolf. The game inherits the same steampunk-induced visual style. The objective of the game is to fly your air balloon over multiple obstacles that will destroy it upon making contact. There are two ways of blowing the balloon. The players are able to either use their left mouse button to inflate the balloon or yell into the microphone if they have one (this is the default control scheme in the game). </p>\n<p>The players can also control the wind flow with the arrow keys. The game&#39;s world is highly interactive, so it is possible to get more speed and elevation using chimneys and steam pipes. The game heavily relies on physics and wind simulation, as the players have to avoid sharp obstacles, mines, and all other sorts of hazards.</p>\n<p>Trailers:<br />\nhttps://youtu.be/jolcjHcUDMM<br />\nhttps://youtu.be/-29qlNLapgU</p>"

The game is not playable as of May 24th, 2018 due to GDPR.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game puts two teams of 5 players against each other. A class-based mechanic is featured in the game. It heavily depends on teamwork as the players have to choose their character right after getting assigned to a team.</p>\n<p>The game features a mix of class-based combat, tower defense style game, and a typical MOBA. The main objective of either team is to destroy the so-called Moneyball of the opposing team. In order to complete the objective, the players have to get through the turret defense, which can only be destroyed by sending out bots on a specific lane. Once the bots get to the turrets, their shield goes down, and the turrets can be destroyed.</p>\n<p>The players are awarded money and experience for every kill they make. Experience is used to level the player&#39;s character up and unlock character-specific skills. The money can be used to summon new waves of bots or purchase temporary powerups at vending machines. </p>\n<p>The game also features a survival mode called Super Blitz which puts five players against the in-game announcer. The players have to defend their Moneyball as the Announcer sents waves of bots to destroy it. The Announcer takes a break every ten rounds which can be used to repair turrets, build new ones or upgrade your character.</p>"

        "description": "At the beginning of this decade, SEGA Studios Australia was working on a series of reboots of classic SEGA IP, known collectively as the SEGA Reborn series. These included 2.5D reboots of Golden Axe, Altered Beast, and Streets of Rage, as well as an endless runner version of Shinobi, all encompassed in a universal hub world. <br/><br/>Sadly SEGA Studios Australia\u2019s doors were shuttered in 2013, and with it the SEGA Reborn project was lost to the annals of video game history. <br/><br/>Until now. <br/><br/><br/><br/>On the occasion of SEGA\u2019s 60th Anniversary, as a special treat to say \u201cThank You!\u201d to our fans, SEGA is releasing a working prototype of Golden Axe Reborn, a single level created as proof-of-concept, or what\u2019s known in the industry as a \u201cvertical slice.\u201d  We\u2019ve dubbed it, tongue in cheek, as \u201cGolden Axed.\u201d  <br/><br/>Golden Axed offers a unique glimpse into the prospect of a project that could have been, and a rare peek behind the curtain at the sometimes tumultuous world of video game development. <br/><br/>We reached out to some of the original development team to bring this dusty gem to light, and they are proud that this project could be revived in some form to be shared with you, the fans.<h3>*Available until 10am PST / 6PM BST October 19th*</h3>"

He attempts to exit the house, but a mysterious voice from the phone screams insults at Anthony and tells him where to find the exit. Tony follows the clues and leaves the house.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The main gameplay mechanic is based on exploration. Like in most escape room games, it is necessary for the players to look for clues in the environment they are in at the moment. Further into the game, the levels are no longer set in a house, but in a park with the landscapes of it being used for several puzzles. </p>\n<p>From level to level, several gameplay mechanics change with the only gameplay element that stays the same is the character movement or item interaction. Everything else is subject to change. These gameplay elements can be used as a puzzle piece in several levels, but most of the time they create an obstacle for the player to pass.</p>\n<p>The developers put a heavy emphasis on the fact that gameplay mechanics were meant to be experimental and unpredictable. This effect is achieved by avoiding the use of the \u201cWhat you see is what you get\u201d principle. There are multiple unexpected turns present in the game. For example, at some point of the game, the players have to jump down a ledge. It first it appears that the main character will fall to his sudden death, yet it appears to be the right direction to move to.</p>"

The game is an endless side-scrolling runner, the first time it appeared on devices running the iOS. Later the game was ported to other platforms, among which two unusual for the first decade of the twenty-first century: browsers in the form of the flash game and Sony Playstation Portable. The last game could be downloaded using the PlayStation Network. The game is often compared to another mobile hit of the era - the game Fruit Ninja, in which the player needs to cut fruits.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The game uses simple one-button control, for which the player can quickly adapt. Pressing the button raises the main character, and if the player releases the button, the protagonist falls. The game has a huge number of upgrades and a lot of enemies. Levels are full of obstacles, in order to get to the next, you need to fly a certain distance, after which the visual style of surroundings and enemies will change. The further you fly, the harder it is.</p>\n<h3>Continuous support</h3>\n<p>Despite being released a long time ago, developers are still updating the game. The story tells about Barry Steakfries, who worked as a vendor in the gramophone manufacturer.

        "description": "<h3>The role model</h3>\n<p>Released in 2008, the game, is similar to another well-known representative of the genre of action-role-playing games God of War series. Developers became studio Liquid Entertainment, and the publisher company Codemasters. The game appeared on the PC and on the most popular consoles of its generation: Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.</p>\n<h3>The story and the setting</h3>\n<p>The plot of the game tells about Jason, and the action takes place in Ancient Greece. Like God of War, the game uses ancient Greek mythology to build a game universe. The modified myth of Jason and the Argonauts, who went on a journey for the Golden Fleece was used as inspiration. According to the scriptwriters of the game, Jason is a Greek king, whose wife was killed in front of him. The only way for a grieving husband to return the beloved is the Golden Fleece, which can resurrect the dead. Other well-known heroes of myths appear in the game: Hercules, Achilles, Medea, Medusa, Patroclus, and others. Together they travel through a variety of real and imaginary locations: Iolcu, Delphi, Mycenae, Tartar, and Kifr.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The game consists of a large number of dialogues and enemies confrontations on vast, detailed levels. In contrast to God of War, critics point out simple battles with bosses and the strange arrangement of enemies on each level, which also simplifies the gameplay. You can use a sword as a weapon, a spear, and a mace is also available. Each weapon has its own characteristics and offers different gameplay: the mace breaks shields, but can not cope with a large number of enemies, the sword reduces the player&#39;s defense capabilities, but increases the effectiveness of melee combat, etc. In addition to these weapons, you can upgrade Jason skills on four branches: Ares, Hermes, Apollo, and Athena. Points for upgrades the player receives as the tasks are completed and for the correct answers in the dialogs.</p>"

Unlike its predecessors, Europa Universalis III uses 3D graphics instead of 2D.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player chooses a country and administers its diplomacy, economy, military, and society. The game has an emphasis on development rather than war, and the combat system does not allow you to directly control the units. You can pick any time period from between 1453 and 1789 and any country from a roster of 300. Despite the series&#39; title, civilizations are not limited to Europe. </p>\n<p>The country&#39;s current leader and state of affairs are generated on the basis of real history. Once the player enters the game, however, the events are randomized and only depend on the player&#39;s actions. A new feature introduced in EU3 is that the player can hire up to three court advisors (EU\u2019s equivalent to Civilization\u2019s \u201cgreat people\u201d). Each advisor has his or her area of influence and helps to improve the empire\u2019s science, culture, or army. </p>\n<h3>Expansion packs</h3>\n<p>Contrary to its name, Complete edition doesn&#39;t include all of EU3 expansion packs (it is Chronicles edition that does), but only two of them: Napoleon&#39;s Ambition and In Nomine. Napoleon&#39;s Ambition is set after the main game&#39;s timeline, lasts until 1821, and deals with the Napoleonic Wars. By contrast, In Nomine begins in 1399, and includes late medieval features like Byzantine Empire, Tamerlan&#39;s conquests, and the Hundred Years War.</p>"

III, a planet full of hostile alien insectoids named Akrid. The story begins ten years after the events of the original game. The climate of E.D.N. III starts getting warmer. Military organization NEVEC begins a dangerous operation to exploit a unique Akrid Cat-G. The game consists of six episodes. In each of the player controls different characters, mainly from NEVEC\u2019s spec-ops. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is divided into six episodes. Each of them consists of several chapters that in their turn consist of several missions. There are no checkpoints during the missions, so each of them requires a player to complete it in one sitting without dying. The player explores levels both by foot and via special mechanized armor suits known as Vital Suits. The Vital Suits have their own set of heavy weapons such as rocket launchers and chainsaw. On foot, the player can use a grappling hook to reach remote places or hang on other Vital Suits. </p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>The game has the strong emphasis on multiplayer. It offers both cooperative and competitive modes. Versus multiplayer shares many similarities to previous games, adding new game modes and customization options.</p>"

The series has been going on for 14 years already, developing the games for all of the PlayStation since PS2. <br />\nCrucial to notice: it is not a rhythm game but a singing game. Here the players need to sing karaoke-style, not match screen patterns with the background beats. Every version of the game differs from the previous one by the song list. It is rare that any technological improvement is included. For example, PS Move support or a special microphone release.<br />\nSingStar (2014) adds AR function for the PS4 gamers: it is now possible to see the lyrics or even avatars through the camera. Other than that it is just a competitive game featuring no plot whatsoever. The Party Mode includes up to eight singers simultaneously \u2014 the competitions like &#39;Pass the Mic,&#39; or &#39;Medley&#39; are available there.</p>"

The main feature of the game is the absence of death in a usual way. Upon death, the player&#39;s soul is sent to the Soul Giver in the underworld, where they can choose a new body. All the skills that the player has learned to the point of his death will stay unaffected. This makes possible the transition of the skills of one class to another which results in countless gameplay combinations and high replay value. It has to be noted that your equipment and potions do not carry over to a new character, just like in most roguelike games.</p>\n<p>The game features a class system with four classes present: Warrior, Assassin, Mage, and Hunter. Each of the classes differs in gameplay and is chosen at the beginning of the game or upon death. A crafting system is also present in the game which allows for upgrading your hero&#39;s equipment on the go. It is possible to craft new armor and weapons, or healing potions.</p>"

Before the wedding, there is a month, and at this time the player needs to get to the opposite part of the country and return his love. In addition, the main hero was overtaken by the creative crisis and couldn&#39;t finish the manuscript of his book. The landlord adds trouble too by expelling him from the apartment for debts.</p>\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n<p>The game continues for 30 virtual days, for which the main character needs to solve one task. How - is the choice of the player. Most decisions made influence the further development of the story, each completion can be unique because the goals can be achieved in different ways. In the game, not only the plot is the non-standard for the genre but also the combat system, which is simply not there. Instead, the game offers the player to understand the relationship of in-game characters and build emotional connections with them. The game has a fairly elaborate character customization system: you can adjust the gender, age, sexual orientation. In addition to the cosmetic effect, it affects how the main character will react in the virtual world.</p>"

It is the first title of the series with the second numerical part of the series a year afterward.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player is presented with the 2D world, which is filled with the ramps, cliffs, railings, and another environment to perform tricks on. As in many titles of its sort, the player gets bonuses for the number of stunts, safety landing and doing combos. The world consists of 50 levels: each one has 5 (250 overall) trophies, accomplishing every one of them unlocks the next level and so on. </p>\n<h3>Stylistics</h3>\n<p>The game features pixel-art graphics presuming the level design to be minimalistic. Such style, nevertheless, brings a unique trait to the game&#39;s mechanics. While it doesn&#39;t feature any of the usual skateboarding title&#39;s trampolines and pools, the minimalistic nature of the Olliolli brings the hardcore out and forces the one behind the controller to mash the buttons repeatedly, memorizing the playthrough during the entire level. Final parts of the game resemble the hardcore platformers like Super Meat Boy more than they resemble traditional skating games like Tony Hawk.<br />\nThe title is also being praised for the soundtrack \u2014 it matches the indie stylistics and is available for sale separately.</p>"

It features very little gameplay and only a semblance of interactivity.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>At the beginning of a new game, the player must undertake a quiz. He or she has to answer several psychological questions by drawing the answers. This is the only gameplay Mountain actually has. Based on the drawings, the program generates a floating mountain that embeds the player&#39;s answers. The user cannot interact with the mountain or influence it. However, he or she can observe it from any angle by rotating the camera with the mouse. By using the keyboard, the player can also influence the game&#39;s piano music.</p>\n<h3>The Mountain</h3>\n<p>The mountain slowly changes over time, acting as a living environment. As the time passes, the mountain goes through the day and night, various seasons, clouds, rains, and snowfalls. New plants can grow and fade on the mountain, and random objects can fall on it out of nowhere. Occasionally, a piece of philosophical text appears on the screen indicating the mountain&#39;s &quot;thoughts.&quot; The mountain eventually collides with a shooting star and collapses.</p>\n<h3>Premise</h3>\n<p>This game was created as an art object and an experiment rather than entertainment. It is meant to fill the time in the background while the user is preoccupied with some other activity. Though hardly a game, Mountain can be used for relaxation and meditation.</p>"

The game is set in a largely open 2D world, in which the protagonist can move in every direction. There&#39;s no side-scrolling, and each section of the world occupies exactly one screen. To help the player to distinguish them, the sections have names, often comical, such as &quot;Nice of you to drop in.&quot;</p>\n<p>At the start of the game, the main character can only run and jump. After the player reaches a certain level, however, the game unlocks additional movements. The protagonist can eventually learn to bounce off the walls and perform double jumps. Nevertheless, the player cannot fight or otherwise defeat the monsters, such as bats and snakes he or she encounters. The only option is to avoid them. There are also collectibles like money bags, but they do not influence the gameplay. Their only role is to provide a 100% walkthrough achievement.</p>\n<h3>Style</h3>\n<p>The game features intentionally pixelated visuals to resemble an 80s arcade. It is accompanied by 8bit sound effects and occasional chiptune music. There&#39;s even an option to emulate a CRT display. The game uses a very limited amount of 8 colors, although the player can choose to switch to a 16-color palette or to change the default colors.</p>"

A virus attack led to a machine uprising, and Mighty No. 9 is among the few robots that were not infected. His creator, Dr. White, sends him to stop his rampaging kin and find out who is behind the attack. The Xel technology allows Beck to bring his fellow Numbers back to reason. He will also assimilate their data to send it back to the lab so that Dr. White could find the cure for the virus. Beck is occasionally assisted by Call, a female robot unaffected by the virus.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Beck in a 2D environment. Like in Mega Man, the protagonist jumps platforms and fires a gun. Beck can also use the special acceleration ability that allows him to leap long distances and through his enemies. By leaping through injured opponents, Beck can assimilate their Xel to receive a temporary power-up. The type of a power-up depends on the color of a Xel: red gives Beck more powerful attacks, green speeds him up, yellow improves his stamina, and blue heals him. Gathering Xel from Mighty Numbers, Beck receives new special abilities.</p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>The game includes a cooperative multiplayer for two, in which the second player controls Call. Her gameplay is very different and is largely defensive as she uses deflector shields to protect herself and Beck.</p>"

Later it was ported to the Mac, and for other consoles in 2013. For Xbox owners, it was distributed free of charge to all holders of the Gold Xbox Live subscription. The game was actively promoted by Microsoft at Game Developers Conference 2008.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The player must defend his own military bases from alien attacks. The latter aimed at power cores, which are located on each map at power plants. To protect the cores player has at their disposal ten different types of towers. They have to be built on platforms specially allocated for this. Thus each level turns into a puzzle, created by the developers for the player to solve. Enemies can not attack the towers, and killing the foes is the only source of resources for the player. Each tower has its own strengths, and for the maximum efficiency, they must be correctly positioned on the map. The player has to defeat Fifteen types of enemies, each like towers, with its own strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n<h3>The Plot</h3>\n<p>There is a story in the game, despite the simplicity of the gameplay. It is based on the fact of an attack by some alien race on the planet, where for some unknown reason the defense grid is disabled. Completing the levels, the player turns on each node of the defense system and eventually one by one and reflects the enemy attack. The game is set in the distant future, and the scenery for the battles contains ancient ruins and military bases built amid the dying grandeur of civilization.</p>"

        "description": "<p>In Hatoful Boyfriend: A School of Hope and White Wings, the player enters the world of sentient birds to romance with them.</p>\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n<p>The game is set in a weird post-apocalyptic future, where the human civilization was taken over by the birds. In a twist similar to Planet of the Apes film series, a pandemic killed most of the humans and transformed birds into sentient beings. They established a new civilization on the ruins of their human predecessors. The few remaining humans survive in the wilderness as hunters and gatherers.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The player assumes the role of a teenage human girl. She is the only human student who was allowed to study at the institute run by the pigeons. She befriends several of her co-students and can become their romantic interest, despite being a member of another species.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Hatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel and therefore has minimal gameplay. The player interacts with the characters mostly by clicking on dialogue options. Some of the options require the main character to have certain stats. The game rewards multiple playthroughs by unlocking documents that reveal more of the game&#39;s world and plot.</p>\n<h3>Endings</h3>\n<p>The game has thirteen endings that depend on the choices made by the protagonist. After the player discovers the certain four endings, the Bad Boys Love mode is unlocked. This mode reinvents the plot with a horror twist. In this mode, the protagonist receives dark visions, and deeper explores the conflicted relationship between birds and humans.</p>"
