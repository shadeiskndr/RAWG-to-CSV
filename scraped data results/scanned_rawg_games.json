It was published by Valve Corporation in digital form and by Electronic Arts in physical form. </p>\n<p>Its plot directly follows the first game&#39;s, taking place in the Half-Life universe. You play as Chell, a test subject in a research facility formerly ran by the company Aperture Science, but taken over by an evil AI that turned upon its creators, GladOS. After defeating GladOS at the end of the first game but failing to escape the facility, Chell is woken up from a stasis chamber by an AI personality core, Wheatley, as the unkempt complex is falling apart. As the two attempt to navigate through the ruins and escape, they stumble upon GladOS, and accidentally re-activate her...</p>\n<p>Portal 2&#39;s core mechanics are very similar to the first game&#39;s ; the player must make their way through several test chambers which involve puzzles. For this purpose, they possess a Portal Gun, a weapon capable of creating teleportation portals on white surfaces. This seemingly simple mechanic and its subtleties coupled with the many different puzzle elements that can appear in puzzles allows the game to be easy to start playing, yet still feature profound gameplay. The sequel adds several new puzzle elements, such as gel that can render surfaces bouncy or allow you to accelerate when running on them.</p>\n<p>The game is often praised for its gameplay, its memorable dialogue and writing and its aesthetic. Both games in the series are responsible for inspiring most puzzle games succeeding them, particularly first-person puzzle games. The series, its characters and even its items such as the portal gun and the companion cube have become a cultural icon within gaming communities.</p>\n<p>Portal 2 also features a co-op mode where two players take on the roles of robots being led through tests by GladOS, as well as an in-depth level editor.</p>"

Now the main cast consists of Gunzerker Salvador(dual-wields guns at command), Siren Maya (holds and paralyzes the enemy), Commando Axton (summons turrets) and Zer0 the Assasin (invisible sniper ninja). But with the DLC players can try out summoning giant flying robots with Gaige the Mechromancer and Krieg the Psycho. <br />\nMost of the game charm and popularity of Borderlands 2 comes from the supporting cast and the personalities of the NPC, making this fast-paced shooter with optional cover stand out.</p>"

And you, as a player, will help this world to survive. This time Gordon arrives in City 17, ravaged and occupied by Combines, where he meets his old Black Mesa friends. <br />\nWhat is different, aside from the overall design quality, is the use of Valve\u2019s Source engine that not only expands on the fluidity of character model animations and movement but allows players to interact with a myriad of objects with the advanced and realistic (to an extent) physics. Classic Headcrab Zombies are revamped and have new variants that provide players with different threats.

Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, he ventures into the brutal Norse wilds with his son Atreus, fighting to fulfill a deeply personal quest. </p>\n<p>His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive\u2026 And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series\u2014satisfying combat; breathtaking scale; and a powerful narrative\u2014and fuses them anew. </p>\n<p>Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son. </p>\n<p>From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War\u2019s breathtakingly threatening landscape\u2014by far the largest in the franchise. </p>\n<p>With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre</p>"

Hostile environments and one-hit deaths may seem difficult, but the game implements a fair amount of checkpoints. The monochrome color palette showcases cartoony proportions of every living thing while making lack of details threatening. Limbo shows you exactly what you encounter, but never how it looks.</p>\n<p>Limbo uses the atmosphere and sound design of the horror genre while avoiding tropes of the modern horror games. The overarching theme and unique style compensated for the rather short game with an abrupt ending, making Limbo one of the most impactful games for the genre.</p>\n<p>The simple controls and easy-to-pick-up mechanics help to make a clear distinction, which part of the stage players can interact with, and which part can lead to the quick death. Even though the game is in black and white, this separation is intuitive and natural, so the player would know exactly where to go or what to do.</p>"

Joining forces with Bruce Wayne for the last time, we have to oppose Scarecrow and other iconic villains such as The Riddler, Harleen Quinzel a.k.a. Harley Quinn, Penguin and others.</p>\n<p>The story continued after events in Arkham City when Joker died due to infection in his blood. Now, Scarecrow tries to release a new fear toxin, meanwhile new mysterious Arkham Knight plots against Batman as well. Still having consequences after being poisoned by the Joker and seeing visions with him, Bruce has to prevail the death of Gotham City.</p>\n<p>The gameplay mechanics stays the same to the Arkham series. Melee combat system, use of the detective skills to find clues and gadgets still play a major role in Batman&#39;s fight against evil. Although now you can travel around not only by your grappling hook but a legendary Batmobile as well. Iconic voices of the characters, Kevin Conroy and Mark Hammil once again return to give their voices for the last game in Arkham series.</p>"

Choosing from three different styles, you can adapt Geralt for any kind of a combat situation. Fast style of fighting gives you an opportunity to strike your opponents with your speed. The strong style focuses itself on destroying your enemies with powerful attacks, while sweeping style is very good when facing a number of foes. You can also craft some potions to gain important benefits such as seeing in the dark or having a larger amount HP. Plot style is unique as well. The game never gives a precise definition of evil, which leads the player to convenient situations where the choice is quite bad anyway.

Many plot aspects are told to the player indirectly or through the secret areas that provide a bit of lore in addition to an upgrade. At the beginning of the game, the player visits a town of Dirtmouth. A town built above the ruins of Hallownest. The players descend down into the ruins to find some answers to his questions.</p>\n<p>The game revolves mainly around the exploration of the in-game world, which requires the players to have some platforming skills. The players have to find secrets that are scattered around the level and battle their enemies. There is a certain degree of backtracking in the game as some areas are locked until the player defeats a certain boss or picks up a specific item. Each area changes as the plot advances so it may be surprising to come back in a certain area. </p>\n<p>The Protagonist uses a nail which serves as a replacement for a sword. Players can attack in four directions. The nail is upgradable.</p>"

Now players will be able not only save Little Sisters from other Big Daddies, and then either harvest ADAM directly, or protect them while they collect ADAM for their new guardian.

The laboratory is destroyed as well as the facility itself, as unknown creatures like Vortigaunts are now everywhere in the facility. Gordon must battle his way to the surface and find a way to close the portal.</p>\n<p>One of the main features of Half-Life was story-telling through scripted sequences within the actual gameplay. Without having cutscenes, the game was able to tell the full story of the game by showing scripted deaths, dialogues, character appearance while the gameplay was moving one. By not ripping off the player from the process, the game feels much more smooth as it continues. Despite his science nature, Gordon is masterfully using his weapons and destroys any enemy at his path with rifles, grenades, shotguns and much more.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man offers the player to take on the role of the most famous Marvel superhero.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game introduces Spider-Man as an already experienced superhero. By the time the game begins, Peter has captured the infamous Kingpin as well as several other supervillains. Now, a gang that goes by the name of Demons poses a new danger to New York. Meanwhile, Peter is working for the scientist Otto Octavius, who didn&#39;t yet become Dr. Octopus, on their science project. Throughout the game, Spidey has to deal with multiple enemies, such as Norman Osbourne, Electro, Vulture, Rhino and Kingpin, among others.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man, from the third person view. There are also sections of the game in which the player controls other protagonists, namely Mary Jane and Miles Morales. The game is set in a 3D environment that is modeled after New York City. The player can travel the city using web slings, running, jumping, and crawling the walls. The setting includes numerous high-rise buildings designed specifically for Spider-Man&#39;s movements.</p>\n<p>As the player progresses, he or she unlocks new suits that grant Spider-Man new abilities, such as additional attacks or enhanced Spider-Sense. The abilities are not tied to the suits, however, and the player can use the suit of his or her choice without losing the ability. The combat system is similar to that in Batman: Arkham, in that Spider-Man fights many opponents in hand-to-hand combat but avoids killing them.</p>"

Players control the young man named Daniel, who wakes up in a seemingly empty castle, alone and with a massive memory loss. Through environmental storytelling, notes, audio logs and even visions, players are invited to uncover the deep-rooted secrets of the castle. <br />\nThroughout the game players will be introduced to the mechanics of Sanity, representing the mental state of Daniel which can be affected by lack of light, visions and even unpleasant encounters with the monsters. When decreased, Sanity will distort the vision of the player to a different and seemingly random effect, in order to depict actual effects of severe anxiety. Most of the game challenges are completed through the item search and physics puzzles, forcing players to be resourceful and courageous.<br />\nThe game supports modding, and allows user-created content alongside the free DLC Justine, telling a story of a female prisoner. Given how short the DLC story is - several possible endings are available.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Dishonored is the game about stealth. Or action and killing people. It is you who will decide what to do with your enemies. You play as Corvo Attano, Empress&#39; bodyguard, a masterful assassin and a combat specialist. All of a sudden, a group of assassins kill the Empress and kidnaps her daughter Emily. Being accused of murder and waiting for execution in a cell, Corvo still manages to escape with the help of the Loyalists and their leader Admiral Havelock. Now it is your duty to return the Empress daughter and restore your name. The main focus of the game is to give the player a choice. You can spare the lives of your enemies by knocking them out or making others do the job for you or brutally murder everyone in the city. Gadgets are given by Piero Joplin, Loyalists engineer and by the Outsider, who gives Corvo magical abilities. The game reacts to your choices - grim atmosphere by itself can be turned even darker by killing people or slightly lighter by not doing so. It is only a player&#39;s choice what to do with his abilities. Basing on these actions the game will give you with two different endings of the story.</p>"

Initially, Don&#39;t Starve is a single-player game with a core mechanic of going through various problems of your character. You have to sleep and eat well. Also, you have to keep your mental health all right and don&#39;t go completely mad at a situation, when these dreadful and twisted creatures are running towards you to tear apart. It seems like the world of Don&#39;t Starve is heavily inspired by Tim Burton, having a very grotesque yet creepy and bizarre-looking monsters and locations with an atmospheric soundtrack.</p>\n<p>While heading to multiplayer, you will experience every single problem from a singles game. The game exploits pretty similar mechanic to Minecraft - randomly generated world, surviving as a top priority for the gamer. With the only difference - if you die, you die. Permanent death of your characters increases the grim and tense atmosphere of the game itself, making the process challenging and creepy. Just remember. Don&#39;t Starve.</p>"

It is set in a medieval fantasy setting, on a continent known as the New World that is being colonized by the humans from the Old World. The plot revolves around a dragon migration called Elder Crossing. Your protagonist is a hunter, whose name and appearance can be customized. You traveled from the Old World to study and hunt the dragons and other local monsters.  <br />\nThe hunter, accompanied by an assistant, starts at the city of Astera, from where they can freely wander the open world. There are six regions in the New World, each with its own base camp. The camps are where you have to thoroughly prepare before every expedition, gathering equipment and provision. Before you can fight monsters, they need to be tracked down using Scout flies and studied to discover their habits, strengths, and weaknesses. There are no character levels, so your hunter\u2019s effectiveness relies on the hunting gear you have equipped. Advanced armor and weapons can be created using a detailed crating system. Many items that you found on missions, including body parts of monsters, can be used for crafting.</p>"

The player gets to know the story without words, but rather through cutscenes. The main character wears a magical scarf, which allows flying for some time, and recharges it with gathered cloth or simply by walking. From time to time the protagonist finds collectible items and discover ruins that can give additional information about the world or the storyline. The only way of interaction with in-game objects is a shout. </p>\n<p>The game transfers the atmosphere of an absolute loneliness. However, during the journey the character can meet other players controlling differently dressed, but generally the same figures. Wandering together can be helpful for both players, as they are able to charge one another\u2019s scarves. The thing is that both players cannot communicate each other in any way, except producing noises. Together players can complete levels and continue moving to their final destination.</p>"

A spin-off from the most popular open-world Early Access game on Steam ARK: Survival Evolved, ARK: Survival of the Fittest (SotF) pits up to 72 combatants in an action-packed struggle for survival where players are ultimately pushed into an epic final showdown where only one \u201cTribe\u201d will make it out alive.</p>\n<p>Survivors can form one- to six-person Tribes with the options to choose Unofficial and Official (Ranked) servers, and a variety of game-lengths and sizes in which to play.

Dedicated eSport ranking, matchmaking, reward, and tournament features make ARK: SotF readily accessible to all players.</p>\n<p>Balanced for intense competition, contestants begin in a neutral staging area where they can communicate pre-game, strategize, or talk trash. After a count-down, they dramatically descend from the sky onto the ARK in a circular formation via beams of light. There is a cache of valuable items in the center \u2013 do survivors dash for the goods and fight it out, do they run into the forest and hide, search for Dinosaurs to rapidly build their army, or do they freeze up from the sheer terror of death? A continually shrinking \u201cring of death\u201d forces contestants ever closer together over time. The hunt is on!<br />\nKEY FEATURES<br />\nAction-Packed Core Survival Gameplay<br />\n30+ Creatures to Tame and Ride at Early Access Start, Many more planned at full launch<br />\nMultiple game modes (1v1, 2v2, 4v4, and 6v6)<br />\nOne-to-Six Player Tribes<br />\nVariable game configurations ranging from 30-minute \u201cinstant action\u201d to three-hour long \u201cepic wars\u201d<br />\nTop-ranked players are listed dynamically on SurviveTheArk.com and are provided monthly prize packages!<br />\nGame-Changing Tameable Super Creatures (Dragon, Giant Ape, Brood Mother)<br />\nRandom \u201cEvolution Events\u201d<br />\nArsenal of Weapons, Traps, Armor, Structures and other Items from Primitive to Modern Tech Tiers<br />\nRobust Ranking, Tournament &amp; Spectator Features<br />\nExclusive SotF Cosmetic Items that can also be used in ARK: Survival Evolved<br />\nCustom-Painted \u201cWar Banners\u201d enable Tribes to show off their team spirit on Flags across their army of Dinosaurs, and are also broadcast on the gigantic billboards during game events.

For 13 long years, Resident Evil series were rejecting the survival-horror aspect and atmosphere of first original games in the series mainly released in nineties on PlayStation one system. From the famous Resident Evil 4 until Resident Evil 6, the series went full-force into action genre leaving horror elements behind and hard-core fans disappointed. Finally, Capcom realized that Resident Evil needs a change and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard delivers those changes at its fullest. First of all, the camera angle changed from over the shoulder view into first-person mode. Another change is that survival-horror elements are back together with light puzzle solving, inventory management and maze-like mansion in which the main story of the game happens. The player controls Ethan Winters who is searching for his lost wife in a dark mansion filled with horrible creatures and insane family. <br />\nResident Evil 7: Biohazard can also be played with virtual reality setup and it\u2019s known as one of the best games which supports VR.</p>"

Therefore, within the game players are able to assume roles of city\u2019s principal architect and mayor. The history of the city, in control of the player, begins with the 2-by-2 kilometers plot of land and a sum of money to start with. Players have to zone the city, build roads, explore the surroundings, provide infrastructure and jobs to attract new citizens. Once the newcomers settle down, the immediate reaction is expected to establish public services and to set proper taxes. Progressing within the game and developing the city will unlock new upgrades of the urban environment and lead to the territorial expansion. The gameplay also requires the control of several city\u2019s parameter scales like budget, health, employment, and pollution. The game also features a creative sandbox mode, where the architect\u2019s imagination is not restricted in any way.</p>"

When using his V-guitar named Clementine, Eddie can cast spells, called Solos, by a simple rhythm game, reminiscent of Guitar Hero. Some story missions are so-called Battles of the Bands, where players will fight the armies in a real-time strategy fashion, and winning by outperforming the enemy band and destroying the stage.</p>"

With their mother dead and father being heavily ill, the only way to save is to bring water from the Tree of Life. But on their way, they will have to challenge the world and themselves. Villages, mountains and forests, bullies, trolls and wolves will await Naiee and Naia on their journey. </p>\n<p>With having such setup, the game found a perfect way to portray this world to the audience. The beautiful visual style and something in between adventure and a platformer make the game an exciting experience. Although that is not the most curious thing about the game. With having two brothers involved in a story, the game actually gives you an opportunity to control both of them. You can solve puzzles by simultaneously moving both of the characters. For example, one of your heroes must distract an enemy, and another is supposed to go behind. This amazing feature provides you with one of the most unique experiences as you play two characters at once.</p>"

Starting to work for Alberto Clemente, Vito must go through every aspect of being a part of the family and become a big thing in it.</p>\n<p>Even though the game has an open world mechanic, you won&#39;t probably explore it. Travelling to missions give an opportunity to listen to music of this time in America - Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Dean Martin and others, providing the game with a great atmosphere of the USA in its 50s. The gameplay has a variety of missions to offer, in which you can confront your enemies in melee combat, shoot them with different guns like M1911 or Thompson, or stealthily engaging your opponents. The game is pretty strict to the player reaching highest of empathy with Vito and every situation he&#39;s in.</p>"

You can either create your protagonist or play as three pre-set options - Albert Cole, Max Stone or Natalia Dubrovhsky. When in Vault 13 water supplies start to malfunction via technical reasons, Overseer sends protagonist in a quest to find a replacement and save the Vault. Having Pip-Boy and some standard equipment, the Fallout world is absolutely open for exploration. </p>\n<p>Although being a completely different genre of the game, Fallout still uses the same systems as we know today. S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system of characters stats (strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck) affect your skills in a variety from 0% to 200%, as well as definitive straits that you choose only once for whole gameplay. Known to players as Karma, you can choose how to act in most of the situations and determine your reputation with other characters in the game.</p>"

Players assume roles of four people \u2013 Ethan Mars, Norman Jayden, Madison Paige, and Scott Shelby \u2013 somehow involved in the case of Origami Killer, who is used to leave his victims alone, marked with origami figures. It soon reveals that all Origami Killer\u2019s murders are connected with weather changes (actually heavy rains). In the course of the completion, players will follow the characters on their way to the key of the murderer\u2019s mystery. Heavy Rain is an unusual action-adventure game. All four main characters are controlled from the third-person perspective with only several buttons, as the interaction with the environment is usually done by activating on-screen prompts like holding the trigger, pushing a button, positioning the stick, or all in one. The gameplay consists of multiple scenes, which affect the further in-game progress by the players\u2019 choice and create a branching storyline that can lead to various endings including the death of certain main characters.</p>"

        "description": "<p>As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!<br />\nDinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you\u2019ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!<br />\nYou must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!<br />\nBy chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.<br />\nPick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!<br />\nBy bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK\u2019s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.<br />\nCreate a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!<br />\nAll items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new &quot;Engrams&quot; to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you&#39;ll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D &quot;Explorer Notes&quot;. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!<br />\nEverything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!<br />\nThe mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you\u2019ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.<br />\nOn the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK&#39;s by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique &#39;Procedurally Generated ARKs&#39;, for infinite replayability and endless surprises.<br />\nYou can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!<br />\nThe over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting &amp; global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) &amp; true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques. Music by award-winning composer of &quot;Ori and the Blind Forest&quot;, Gareth Coker!</p>"

        "description": "<p>Unturned is a low-poly survival game providing single or multiplayer experience. The main action takes place on 6 different maps (Prince Edward Island, Yukon, Washington, Germany and Russia) flooded with zombies. The story begins in the random location of the chosen map and lasts till the death. Playing for one of the few people not yet turned into a zombie, you should stay aware of various natural or unnatural dangers, gather required resources, and make your way through the tough survival. Survivors meet thirst, hunger, disease, injures, zombie bites, and other hostile players looking for safety. Since land, air and sea vehicles are available, players can choose the most suitable transport to explore the entire map. The gameplay stands for the wider opportunity of customization of pretty much everything in the in-game world, starting with simple object destruction and following to guns modification and shelters construction. In-app purchases do not actually affect the gameplay, but due to the cosmetic system, plenty of items (clothing and weapon skins) are purchasable or available in crates.</p>"

The surrounding objects are created with maximum realism, the degree of damage depends on the calibre of the bullets used by the players or on the total power of the laid explosives. Walls can be destroyed, creating new firing positions and shelters. Optimal use of the potential of destruction often becomes a guarantee of victory. Defenders can limit the ability of attackers to destroy, using kits to strengthen the walls and the device of some operatives.</p>\n<p>The primary game mode - multiplayer, normal or rating. During the game in the last mode, the player is assigned a certain rank, and parameters such as the ratio of kills/deaths and wins/losses are recorded in his profile displayed in the game.</p>"

The action is set 15 years after the film events. Young Amanda Ripley accompanied by Nina Taylor and the android Christopher Samuels reaches a distant space station Sevastopol to investigate the case of her mother Ellen Ripley (the protagonist of the 1979 film) disappearance. On the way to the Nostromo\u2019s (Ellen\u2019s spacecraft) flight recorder, Amanda will face plenty of hardships like hostile androids and Aliens because the Sevastopol station is wholly abandoned. Players have to explore the entire station inhabited with Aliens. Due to the crafting system, players can create the necessary gear to prevent contacts with countless enemies.</p>"

The plot follows a fictionalized story of the Peloponnesian War between city-states of Sparta and Athens that left Greece devastated. The player can choose to control either a male (named Alexios) or female (named Kassandra) protagonist, both of them being descendants of the famous Spartan king Leonidas. The player enters the plot as a mercenary and can side with either Athens or its rival Sparta. There&#39;s also the frame story set in the contemporary age. Its protagonist is Layla Hassan, who was also the main character in the frame story of Assassin&#39;s Creed Origins.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Unlike most earlier installments of Assassin&#39;s Creed, which put the emphasis solely on action, Odyssey has a strong role-playing element in it. Dialogue options and the non-linear plot allow the player to reach several alternate endings. The game also has a reputation system and multiple options for romancing, including same-sex romances. The combat system is similar to that in Origins with the addition of new skills. The game also reintroduces naval battles.</p>"

The main protagonist is a member of a shinobi clan. A samurai from the rival Ashina clan captured the protagonist&#39;s master, and the protagonist himself lost his arm trying to protect his leader. However, a sculptor of Buddha statues managed to replace the lost limb with an advanced prosthetic arm. The protagonist accepted a new name, Sekiro, meaning \u201cone-armed wolf\u201d.

Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice features an innovative combat system that doesn&#39;t use hit points. Instead, the opponents can be killed with a single precision strike. However, the player has to fight his or her way through the opponent&#39;s blocks and parries to land the deadly blow. The main character fights with his sword (katana) in the right hand, while his left hand can host a variety of upgrades, such as an ax, a torch, or a shield. The game also emphasizes stealth action. The player has to use a grappling hook to access multiple locations. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice has no multiplayer.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Metro Exodus is the third installment in the Metro series. It is based on the series of post-apocalyptic novels by Russian writer Dmitry Glukhovsky. The game is the sequel to Metro: Last Light and is set two years after its ending.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Exodus takes place in the year 2036 in post-apocalyptic Russia. According to the Metro universe backstory, in 2013 the planet was devastated by a total nuclear war. The atomic bombing left many parts of the Earth&#39;s surface uninhabitable due to high radiation rates, dangerous mutated monsters, and anomalies abound. The last remnants of humanity survive by hiding in the subway tunnels (hence the name of the series). The main protagonist is Artyom, a former dweller of Moscow Metro. Together with his wife Anna, he escaped the capital to search for survivors in the Russian Far East (thus making the \u201cRedemption\u201d ending of the Last Light the series&#39; canon). </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Artyom from the first person view. Exodus introduces the sandbox open-world, although the game combines it with the traditional linear levels. Unlike in previous games, Exodus is set mostly outside the subway system. Thus, the game also introduces the weather, the day and night cycle and the change of seasons. The player explores the Russian wilderness during and after the nuclear winter and rides a steam locomotive named Aurora through Siberia.</p>"

When our protagonist, War arrives on Earth, he sees that the final battle between Good and Evil already emerged without breaking Seven Seals. After fighting a demon called Straga, he is summoned by the council. It accuses him of destroying the balance, and that now the Apocalypse is unstoppable. Convincing the council in his innocence, War now has to stop the Endwar.</p>\n<p>Darksiders is a typical hack-and-slash game that lets you produce comboes with two primary weapons - Chaoseater and Scythe - and various gadgets.

Each planet you visit is generated from scratch.

The main objective is to reach the center of the galaxy. </p>\n<p>On release, it was stated that the game is in fact multiplayer, but the size of its world is so big that the probability of meeting another player is extremely small. It turned out that it is impossible to meet any other player due to the extremely limited multiplayer aspect. As of 2018, Hello Games released the fourth major update which included the full multiplayer experience.</p>"

The game is set in the world of pre-Roman age and includes 3 locations: Ancient Greece, Egypt, and eastern civilizations. The story begins with a narration about Titans, who ruled the entire world before the Olympians. The idea is that a trio of Telkines managed to break off the communication between Earth and Olympus and started terrorizing the mortal world. The protagonist is a hero, who is expected to defeat Telkines and to restore the conduit linking to worlds. To assume the role of the mythical hero players need to customize their own character: choose the gender and appearance. The further action continues in a traditional hack and slash manner. Players navigate the 3D world through the overhead third-person view and lead the protagonist with the mouse, while special abilities are tied to keyboard buttons. The Anniversary edition includes all possible fixtures and improvements of graphics and gameplay.</p>"

Layla Hassan relieves the memories of two ancient Egyptians named Bayek and Aya who create the Assassins order.</p>\n<p>Levels are open-ended which allows both stealth or open combat approaches. Players are put in an open world in which they can complete quests in order to either progress through the story, level their character up or upgrade their equipment. The &quot;eagle vision&quot; mode was replaced by an eagle by the name of Senu. Players can use Senu to scout the area ahead and highlight enemies.</p>\n<p>The game features a heavily revised combat system that relies on hit-box mechanics rather than pre-determined animations as it did in the previous titles. Origins focuses on introducing various types of enemies that the players will have to learn about in order to defeat them.</p>"

Players can engage in diplomacy between neighboring households, sign treaties and create a bloodline between two families, forge documents and declare wars. However, the primary competitive objective would not be conquering the world, but instead, winning the prestigious ranks and ensuring that your family will prosper.<br />\nGameplay-wise, the mechanics revolve around interactions with your neighbors and your court. Buildings built, armies trained, but most importantly, your character should be built, too. Education, marriage, religion - everything will affect your lord-protege, and players often come up with different guides on how to achieve success without regards to the luck and skill of the player.</p>"

Although the game is a part of the Battlefield franchise, it has no references to the previous chapters. Players are able to experience both single and multiplayer mods to get in action and to feel the era better. As a single-player campaign, Battlefield 1 offers 6 storylines (chapters) one following each other. Each consists of several missions and tells a story of a single man in the middle of a global military conflict. Playing for these soldiers and closing the targets introduces new game mechanics to players. Completing these missions gives an opportunity to dive into the history and to examine the warfare of past ages. Multiplayer experience is divided into 9 different game mods spread on 31 historical maps. You can join the dynamic battle alone or in a squad with your friends. Multiplayer allows you to assume different battlefield roles (classes) starting with a medic, support or assault and following to the tank driver, pilot and some elite units.</p>"

The game was made as an attempt to reboot the franchise. <br />\nJust as previous entries, the game takes place in the dark fantasy world with notable steampunk and Victorian era influence. You play as Garrett, the master thief who awakens after one-year slumber caused by accident in one of his missions. He finds out that his hometown is plagued by a mysterious disease \u201cThe Gloom.\u201d <br />\nThe gameplay can be described as first-person stealth-action with the heavy emphasis on the variability of completing missions. Sneaking behind the enemies is usually a more effective way of performing tasks than openly fighting with them. Garrett possesses several different tools and weapons like lockpicks, prybar, etc. One of Garrett\u2019s few weapons is bow which has 8 types of arrows and the full range of application from killing and poisoning enemies to putting out torches and distracting guards.</p>"

Winter brings cold and freezes water, requires more health and firewood.<br />\nDecisions that have to be made often have a moral dimension - can one rob an unarmed person if this is a matter of life and death for someone from the group?<br />\nAs in life, events are seen as random and do not repeat from game to game. The same characters can behave very differently, and the siege can sometimes last twenty days, and sometimes eighty.</p>"

After sustaining heavy injuries in the battle with Wilhelm &quot;Deathshead&quot; Strasse, BJ Blaskowicz orders a nuclear strike on Deathshead&#39;s compound in order to cripple the Nazi war machine, but he is evacuated by his comrades before the rocket launch. Blaskowicz falls unconscious for 5 months and is woken up by a Nazi attack. The player has to repel the attack and end the Nazi reign over America once and for all.</p>\n<p>The New Colossus features several stealth-action elements, just like the previous title in the series. There are some major differences in the mechanics: now BJ can modify his weaponry on-the-go, dual wield two different weapons at the same time. The cover system makes a comeback. The Protagonist doesn&#39;t stick to cover, leaning out of it instead.</p>\n<p>The game offers a linear storyline, but the player is free to complete side-missions in any order they like. Completing these missions is rewarded with new weapon upgrades.</p>"

This time, our famous adventurer Lara Croft and her rival tomb raider Carter Bell travel to Egypt to search for the ancient temple, where a magical artifact, Stuff of Osiris, is hidden. The game is set in the temple and its dungeons, designed in Ancient Egyptian aesthetics. Besides shooting monsters, Lara and her partners have to avoid all kind of traps that will immediately remind you of Indiana Jones films. Completing specific missions will grant the player rings and amulets that enhance characters&#39; skills and abilities.</p>\n<p>Just like the previous game, The Guardian of Light uses the isometric view. The game allows for a cooperative mode for up to four players. All puzzles are automatically adjusted to the number of players. You can play not only as Lara but also as her friendly rival Carter Bell and two Egyptian gods, Isis and Horus, who were imprisoned in the temple for millenniums by the evil god Set. Their goal is to gather together and revive Osiris, the god who was dismembered by Set, and who can save the Earth from Set&#39;s evil. While human characters use firearms and grappling hooks, the gods are armed with the magic Stuff of Osiris.</p>"

All the traditional victory types are in place, and a new one, religious, is introduced.</p>\n<p>A distinct new feature in the sixth part is that city improvements are no more concentrated in each city&#39;s only main tile. Instead, they are distributed throughout its whole surrounding area. Each of them is now considered a &quot;district&quot; with a specific purpose, and some of them should be built only on specific terrain. Similarly, wonders now occupy tiles on their own. Technology tree was also modified to take into account the player&#39;s terrain improvements that may speed up the research of certain technologies. Cultural achievements, such as Opera or Drama, are no more considered &quot;technologies&quot; and form a separate Civics research tree instead. Also, unlike most of its predecessors, Civilization VI allows stacking similar types of military units.</p>"

Even though it is a platformer game in which you solve puzzles in the dimension your looking at, you can manipulate with the world itself by rotating it all around. Because of that very interesting mechanic that is not so popular in the industry, the game is actually is a 2D in a 3D world. In order to proceed from one level to another, you have to collect cubes or fragments of it. However, by rotating the world, you can actually gain access to some places that wouldn&#39;t be available without this mechanic. </p>\n<p>Gomez, our protagonist, must restore the order in his universe by passing through the levels and collecting little fragments of it. But he will face no threat at all. Your only challenge is to actually beat these quite peculiar puzzles, basically without any guidelines at all. As stated by a developer himself, this game is about &quot;stop and smell the flower&quot;, which makes it a brilliant stress-relief or a relaxing sort of the game with slow gameplay and nice atmosphere.</p>"

The game reproduces this work - but scammers and unusual situations occur in it much more often than in reality. The task of the player-officer is not to make a mistake, not to let an unwanted guest into the country. He has power, directories, translucent devices, etc., but experienced masters of deception and fraud act against him. The task of the player is complicated by the fact that his country is like all the paranoid dictatorships at the same time. This country fears a lot, seeks to control everything and periodically generates various rules. The game has a lot of humour, a lot of exciting puzzles and unexpected twists, including shooting. The visual and musical design of the game reflects the bizarre world of stupid rules, constant fear and mutual distrust.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Quake Champions is a multiplayer competitive FPS developed by Id Software.</p>\n<p>The gameplay resembles the same arena shooter mechanics as the previous installments. For the first time in the series, the so-called champions appear in the game. Each champion has a different amount of health, top speed and a unique ability that can be used once in 20-45 seconds depending on the champion and needs to be recharged after usage. The abilities are designed using the rock-paper-scissors principle with each ability serving as a counter to another. This was done in order to put emphasis on a player&#39;s skill and not the chosen character. The game also features character customization system which allows changing the look of any selected champion.</p>\n<p>There is no loadout system in the game whatsoever. Players have to pick up the weapons scattered on the map.</p>\n<p>Players can download the game for free, yet they will have access to only one Champion, Ranger. The players have to either rent new champions using the in-game currency or by the so-called champions pack that will unlock every in-game character for an unlimited amount of time.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Gunslinger is the fourth installment of the Call of Juarez series of western-inspired games. The frame story, told in cutscenes, begins in 1910, in Kansas, where Silas, a patron in the pub, brags about his adventures in the Wild West. This old man claims he used to be a bounty hunter who took down many of the famous outlaws. Most of the game has the player re-enacting Silas&#39;s presumed past, while in the present the hero is narrating his own story off-screen. Silas is an unreliable narrator, however, and his own in-game audience will point at plot holes in his tall tales. </p>\n<p>Like the rest of Call of Juarez games, Gunslinger has every classic staple of the western genre. There are saloons and gold mines, stagecoaches, Indians and cowboys, sheriffs and gangs. The protagonist will escape prison, wander the Wild West, fight brigands and other enemies using a variety of late XIX century firearms, and occasionally sing country songs. Gunfights and duels are the central features of the game. There&#39;s even a Duel mode, in which the player can enter a tournament of gun duels, and the Arcade mode, in which multiple opponents attack the player. Gunslinger also introduces quick time events that allow the player to evade bullets.</p>"

The game takes place at a remote island, where the players take place of the Prisoner. The Prisoner does not speak, yet he can express confusion and frustration using his body language. The Prisoner is basically immortal, as, in case of death, his head disconnects itself from the Prisoner&#39;s body, and gets back to the game&#39;s starting area. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game&#39;s heavily inspired by The Binding of Isaac, as stated by the developers.</p>\n<p>Dead Cells features the procedurally generated environments that are typical for roguelike games, yet it puts a strong emphasis on exploration that is typically found in metroidvanias.</p>\n<p>The players set out to explore the island where a prison was built. As the players come down into the dungeons of the island, they find various loot, fight dangerous creatures, collect armor, abilities, and power-ups. Upon death, the players lose all the loot they had on them. It is possible to find a shopkeep somewhere in the dungeons to purchase new equipment or have some rest. </p>\n<p>The game uses death as a learning experience, as it randomizes the placement of enemies, so the players can&#39;t take multiple attempts to complete a level. The developers want the player to examine the enemy behavior and learn how to combat the enemies themselves.</p>"

According to the storyline, the New Kid meets the army of humans led by Wizard King Cartman in the Kupa Keep Kingdom (Cartman\u2019s backyard) and gets his nickname Douchebag. Cartman, as well as other characters of the original series, introduce The Stick of Truth, the key to the war between humans and elves, to the New Kid.

To start the campaign, players have to choose one of the character types (Fighter, Thief, Mage, and Jew), each with its own parameters and special abilities. Completing the levels and eliminating the enemies gives experience points that could be spent on learning new skills or upgrading the level. The gameplay also features fast travel ability. Remarkable characters of the original series \u2013 Cartman, Butters, Stan, and Kyle \u2013 join the protagonist during his wild adventure.</p>"

You control Ryley Robinson, a space traveler in the 22nd century, who crash-landed his starship on a planet that is covered almost entirely by the ocean. The protagonist needs to eat and drink, although this can be disabled in lower difficulty modes. He can desalinate oceanic water, catch or gather the seafood, and create useful tools and structures. Unlike many survival games, Subnautica has a detailed plot, in which Ryley has to uncover why his ship crashed. By exploring the ocean, finding the remnants of other crashes, and listening to the radio messages, Robinson will learn about the enormous Leviathan, the mysterious Precursors, and the reason why this planet is quarantined.<br />\nThe game is famous for its spectacular portrayal of the ocean and its wildlife. Robinson is equipped with a scuba diving gear that allows the player to spend most of the game underwater, although oxygen still has to be replenished. The player can dive deep and explore the world full of corals, fish, and other colorful sea creatures, often grotesque or bio-luminescent. The environment is randomly generated to improve replayability.</p>"

The gameplay is almost similar to the original Half-Life\u2019s: the storyline continues by navigating through the sequence of levels. Each level consists of both combat part and solving puzzles. Although Blue Shift is an expansion to the original Half-Life, both weaponry and enemies range face no changes or additions, so players use same guns to shoot same aliens.

        "description": "<p>Castle Crashers is 2D beat-em-up game with role-playing elements developed by Behemoth. It was initially released in 2008 via Xbox Live Arcade with following ports for PS3, Windows, and macOS. In 2015 it was remastered as Castle Crashers Remastered and was released for Xbox One.  <br />\nYou play as a knight sent by the king to defeat an evil wizard who stole the king\u2019s daughters and captured and mystical gem. The gameplay is very reminiscent of older side-scrolling beat-em-up titles. It can be summarized as a player has to defeat waves of enemies in different locations using his weapons and magical abilities. However, it also incorporates some role-playing elements such as acquiring gaining new levels which allow a player to enhance his stats and acquire new moves. One of the gameplay\u2019s focal points is cooperative multiplayer with the support for up to 4 players which is available both locally and online.  <br />\nThe game shares significant Behemoth hand-drawn visual style which was used before in Alien Hominid and would be later used in studio\u2019s BattleBlock Theater and Pit People.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Resident Evil 4 is a third-person shooter game developed by Capcom Production Studio 4 and published by Capcom. The sixth major installment in the Resident Evil series, it was originally released for the GameCube in 2005. Players control U.S. government special agent Leon S. Kennedy, who is sent on a mission to rescue the U.S. president&#39;s daughter Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a cult. In a rural part of Europe, Leon fights hordes of villagers infected by a mind-controlling parasite, and reunites with the spy Ada Wong.<br />\nDevelopment began for PlayStation 2 in 1999. Four proposed versions were discarded; the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami. In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower survival horror gameplay of previous instalments, the team focused on developing more dynamic shooting action.<br />\nResident Evil 4 was announced as a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but was ported to numerous formats, becoming a cross-platform hit, selling over 10 million copies across all platforms. It garnered acclaim for its narrative, gameplay, voice acting, and characters, and is often named one of the best video games, winning multiple Game of the Year awards in 2005. It influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the &quot;over-the-shoulder&quot; third-person view. Resident Evil 5 was released in 2009.</p>\n<h1>Gameplay</h1>\n<p>The player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series&#39; previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.<br />\nResident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a &quot;finishing move&quot; on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game&#39;s many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.<br />\nThe main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (&quot;The Cattle&quot; in Spanish). Los Ganados can dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other.<br />\nThe inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attach\u00e9 case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.<br />\nCapcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is &quot;Separate Ways&quot;, a minigame which focuses on Ada Wong&#39;s involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series&#39; villain Albert Wesker. &quot;Ada&#39;s Report&quot;, a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada&#39;s relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigames &quot;The Mercenaries&quot; and &quot;Assignment Ada&quot; (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser.</p>\n<h1>Plot</h1>\n<p>U.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President&#39;s daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. He travels to a nameless rural village in Spain, where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.<br />\nWhile in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former Los Illuminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of Los Illuminados, reveals his plan to use the plaga they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a &quot;sample&quot; once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.<br />\nAfter killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Illuminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler&#39;s henchmen who owns the castle, and the two become separated by Salazar&#39;s traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley&#39;s infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon&#39;s hands. While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.<br />\nAfterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary&#39;s intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser&#39;s fatal defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada&#39;s help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes.</p>"

Concerning story, the game is connected to the previous game and changes the cast of characters and even Dante\u2019s (the series main protagonist) iconic appearance (which was met with indignation from the series fans at the time). The game\u2019s story is notable for its social commentary regarding mass-media and modern capitalism drawbacks.  <br />\nThe gameplay overall is very similar to the other installments of the Devil May Cry series and is heavily focused on fast-paced fighting with hordes of demons with occasional puzzles and platforming sections. The main change in the game\u2019s combat mechanics is the Angel and Devil modes. They alternate Dante\u2019s and attacks and special abilities. The modes are activated by holding left or right trigger (on the controller) which makes switching between them instant and allows performing complex combos, combining each mode\u2019s unique features.</p>"

Players are offered to join the protagonist\u2019s space adventures to complete his main mission and to force a Necromorph outbreak. As in the previous part, Isaac uses a special Resource Integration Gear \u2013 special suit, which displays important in-game parameters including health and oxygen level (required for vacuum spaces), and which also serves as a gameplay HUD. In case if one of the scales reaches the zero point, Isaac will die, and the game will be restarted from the last checkpoint.</p>"

At the same time, Jodie is periodically exposed to attacks of vague energies.<br />\nHer parents are not her relatives, they give her to psychiatrists and refuse her. When the family of one of the psychiatrists perishes, Jodie, with the help of Ayden, establishes a connection with the deceased, she can let the living and the dead speak.<br />\nThe CIA is interested in Jodie&#39;s abilities and makes her become an agent. She then instructs her on several missions, but Jodie realises that she is being used for criminal activities - and refuses to cooperate with the CIA. CIA agents do not leave her alone, and she destroys them.<br />\nThe game has a lot of interpretations of what is happening in the world of the dead, different people use Jodi&#39;s forces in different ways. Jody herself also does not have a clear picture, she seeks and finds real parents, helps different people - but they rarely pay her the same.</p>"

The genre itself is well-established already with giants like Diablo series, but Torchlight offers the fresh experience for veterans and newbies alike.<br />\n  The steampunk fantasy world lets players enjoy the lush grass of various beautiful environments, the glowing caves filled with mushrooms, and the endless deserts with their treasures! Lots of different enemies always try their best to stop our adventurers from their goal. From every corner there comes danger, only briefly allowing the players to collect their thoughts and dive yet again in battle with evil.<br />\n  Following Torchlight, the second game starts with chaos erupting from underneath the world. A crazed former hero now takes the lead of hordes of different creatures, and in defeating him and his minions lies the ultimate goal of our new heroes. Take on the mantle of one of the four available classes, and be sure to utilize their might at its fullest. Stay flexible, for the treasure is always surprising, and don\u2019t forget to use your trusty companion as the aid in battle, or as a heavy-packed war mule. Be ready for harsh defeats, or, if you feel like immortal, try the hardest difficulty for the ultimate roguelike challenge. The world of Torchlight is yours to explore!</p>"

A full arsenal of modern weapons, from dozens of models of knives, small and heavier guns, from boats and helicopters to tanks and warships - all this is either at the player&#39;s disposal or meets him during missions. On land and sea, in the city and in the air. The game responds to everyone and everything. Weather - rain and wind change everything, as in life. The wet foliage behaves differently than the dry, gusts of the wind act on everything in the entire space of the map, the shower makes the air less transparent, thickens the darkness. Water is not just a surface, but water, with waves that you swing - in multiplayer, these waves are for everyone, their behavior is calculated exactly as the real waves would behave, players feel them precisely with the same difference for their position, as if they were in the actual sea, on the same wavelength, but in different places. Seven missions, five additions, three variants of the ending. The ability to see the gameplay through the eyes of any of the players, above the entire card, in a third-person mode and in the &quot;Free Cam&quot; mode. Multiple multiplayer modes, classes and game factions.</p>"

So you progress through similar levels killing enemies and trying to figure out what&#39;s happening.\u00a0<br />\nBesides original time mechanics, the game makes you quite vulnerable: a single enemy shot kills you making start the level again.

During the levels Bros fight against terrorists in the setting of games of the 80s to rescue other Bros. The gameplay features special combat mechanics: each Bro has two different attacks (first is constant and endless, while the second requires recharging) and a melee weapon to climb the obstacles. However, enemies can be also defeated by using distracting maneuvers. Bros also have special abilities like parkour skill or explosion resistance. The level can be completed only if another Bro is rescued, terrorists with their boss are eliminated, and the American flag is set on the enemies\u2019 base. After each mission, the location explodes and Bros fly away by helicopter.</p>"

        "description": "<p>FTL: Faster Than Light is a roguelike strategy game set in space civil war in the Galactic Federation. You control a spaceship that has to deliver an essential package of data to the Federation headquarters. This data can help defeat the rebel\u2019s army and finish the war. To do so, you have to travel through eight procedurally generated space segments. Within those segments, the player can encounter other ships and NPCs both friendly and hostile as well as random events.  <br />\nThe gameplay\u2019s key feature is that the player does not control the spaceship itself but rather the ship\u2019s crew. During the game, the player can hire or rescue new crew members from different races. Each team member has its characteristics that affect how well he can handle different systems on the ship or his movement speed and fighting skills.  <br />\nThe game is notable for its high difficulty primarily since ship\u2019s destruction causes save files deleting.</p>"

The girl\u2019s moves are controlled in a point-and-click way. The story progresses through short scenes including dialogues with other characters, which can impact upcoming events by selecting certain dialogue options, or short-term action events like defending the camp from walkers. The gameplay also features some sort of exploration and interaction with the environment that can give extra information or various collectible items. On the way through the game players are going to face dramatic turns of the plot caused by their own tough choice.</p>"

For example, a mission in which it is necessary to steal weapons technology from an enemy planet - to execute it, you need to knock out as many brains as possible from giant flying octopuses. Why? Because these brains can exchange the necessary technology from one local scientist, who needs brains for the experiments, but the boss does not give it to him.<br />\nThe gameplay consists of destroying enemies in a variety of unexpected ways, with weapons of fourteen kinds, and among them a shotgun that turns enemies into pixel pictures and then crushes them into pixels. There are a lot of such finds in the game. In addition to shooting, there are chases and other things. And besides weapons - a lot of useful original devices.</p>"

The city is an open world for the player\u2019s exploration, and many gameplay features revolve around interacting with the surroundings. A huge aspect of immersion would be music, as it is themed according to the geographical location of the city.<br />\nThe main character Wei Shen finds himself in various situations which lead to the development of the main story. Resolving conflicts between local citizens and Hong Kong\u2019s organized crime, the protagonist is offered to join one of the city\u2019s gangs. Due to this, the players need to plan their actions carefully, building trust among both the gangsters and the police. <br />\nThe game features an unlock-based role-playing system, where every consecutive ability or trait is unlocked after the player achieves a specific goal or levels up character\u2019s prestige in each of the three in-game groups. The combat system is heavily reliant on the character\u2019s skill of martial arts, but conventional weaponry is also a favorable choice. Non-story related interactions add flavor to the overall gameplay, as there is a wide choice of how to spend the protagonist\u2019s free time.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Like original Postal, its sequel was specifically intended to spark controversy. The game is full of gross violence, black humor, obscenities, and biting satire of American life. The plot follows Postal Dude, a typical &quot;white trash&quot; and a small town trailer-park dweller, as he is given menial daily tasks, such as buying milk. The way he completes them, however, is what makes Postal 2 one of the most censored and offensive games ever. At the various points of the game, the player may piss over his opponents, use cats as gun silencers (by literally showing your gun up the cat&#39;s anus), burn dogs alive, blow up cars (but not drive them, in Postal 2 cars are simply four-wheeled explosives), shoot people and flip them a bird. The game, however, is just as violent as the player wants it to be. Most missions can be accomplished without killing, though it would have spoiled all the fun.<br />\nThe gameplay has changed since the previous part. Isometric view from the original was replaced with the first-person view. The world around Postal Dude is living by itself, regardless of the player\u2019s presence, much like in Grand Theft Auto series. All the town inhabitants are programmed to walk, chat and even fight each other as if they were real people.</p>"

While mastering this Spider-Man-like potential, the hero encounters various non-hostile NPCs and environment, the only menacing obstacle in the game is a one-eyed worm, lurking in one of the caves. However, the worst scenario is that it blows you off the cliff. Worm likes to take a nap so getting over him is not a big deal.<br />\nThe plot follows a boy looking for his uncle, Freud.

However, it is not a full-fledged sequel to the game but rather a spin-off. The game\u2019s tone and style are much more light-hearted and comedic than in the original, and the color palette is significantly brighter. <br />\nThe game\u2019s story takes place two years after the original game in a fictional town Night Springs, Arizona. The series protagonist, Alan Wake, must defeat his dark doppelganger, Mr. Scratch to escape the Dark Place. American Nightmare\u2019s gameplay is very similar to that of the original game; however, this time it is much more action-oriented, rather than story-driven. Its combat is centered around the same chief combat mechanic \u2013 focusing the flashlight on enemies on making them vulnerable to weapon.</p>"

First, doctors learn from his memory his past to find out why before his death he wants to fulfil such a strange desire - to go to the Moon.<br />\nThen there is a strong story about meetings and partings, about promises and losses. It ends well, but only in the patient&#39;s memories.<br />\nThe gameplay consists of the study of small locations, the solution of simple puzzles and long, saturated dialogues.

This game is the first part of the PAYDAY series and the beginning of the story of four outlaws \u2013 Dallas, Hoxton, Chains and Wolf. The gameplay is about completing 6 different heists throughout America alone (with bots) or in a team (up to 4 members). Each robbery could be carried out in two separate ways: players should decide whether stealth or a breakthrough attack is more suitable and prepare all the ammunition properly in advance. The squad of criminals searching for another \u201cbig score\u201d is set up against easy-to-manipulate civilians and powerful police forces, so players are to try their best to prevent the alarm signals and not to face armed resistance. However, if the heavy combat begins, the best option will be to keep shooting countless enemies down till the money is in the bag and the heist is over.</p>"

An anomaly breaks out, and hordes of monsters invade Black Mesa.<br />\nWhile Black Mesa and Half-Life are basically the same game, there are many subtle changes besides the improved graphics. The amount of ammo has changed, as well as the order in which the weapons appear in the game. The iconic crowbar is found in a different place. There are also new options like zooming in and out and reprogramming gun turrets. Some of the levels were shortened, and some of the monsters became stronger. NPCs became more intelligent, and they will perform certain actions to aid Gordon. Design of the characters also became more varied, and women finally appeared in the game.

The almost cinematic experience of every battle allows players to immerse in the darkest hours of humankind fully. The warfare itself in the game is exceptionally refined, featuring cover systems and different damage types, making players plan their movements, know their enemies and know themselves. However, not every battle is won by plans, and thus, reaction to the surroundings also plays a significant role.<br />\nCompany of Heroes successfully reimagined how WWII RTS should look like and play like, with its different squad compositions, various routes to be taken, and new challenges in the form of multiplayer battles with players who will try to outcompete you, outplay you and overrun your forces.</p>"

You play as Bob, a fully customizable character that travels from one dream to another. Bob has neither no background nor superpowers. His abilities don\u2019t differ from yours: he can grab things, climb ledges and so on. </p>\n<p>Every level consists of multiple puzzles that can be solved in different ways. You can push and pull carts, break walls and interact with everything else comparable to your own size. The game heavily focuses on physics. Puzzles\u2019 solutions are intuitive and make you act like in real life. In their core levels are quite linear: you need to reach the door at another side of the location to get into the next dream. While at the first levels you need to find exits from tiny rooms, the further you go, the larger locations become. There is a lot of content in the game in general, and it clearly references the sandbox genre where you can do almost everything you want.</p>"

Players are offered to take control of Abe on his way to the liberation of the rest of enslaved Mudokons. The gameplay features classic platformers\u2019 mechanics: all the action is divided into 2D levels that should be passed. In the course of the completion, Abe is going to solve puzzles, overcome obstacles and defeat (or dodge) enemies. Each players\u2019 mistake from failing a grenade throw to falling from high ground will cause death and a restart of the level from the last checkpoint, which means difficulties. On the way through the Oddworld Abe can use his supernatural ability to telepathically influence Sligs (unplayable characters).

        "description": "<p>The Long Dark is a game about surviving in the unforgiving conditions of frozen North Canadian taiga. The Arctic wilderness may be breathtakingly beautiful, thanks to the game\u2019s artful visual style, but it is also deadly. Low temperatures, hungry animals like wolves and bears, and starvation can easily kill your character. To stay alive, he will need to learn how to light a campfire, find shelter, care about his wounds, hunt for food and protect himself in an unfriendly environment. Many necessary items in the game, including some of the weapons, need to be crafted out of the junk that you can find in the woods and in abandoned buildings.<br />\nIn the story mode, called Wintermute, you control a pilot, Will Mackenzie, who was hired by his ex-wife Astrid to deliver a mysterious cargo. Eventually, his plane crashed in the woods. Will is injured, and Astrid is missing, presumably lost somewhere in the wilderness. Your goal is to survive and to rescue your companion. Wintermute follows a linear plot and only allows you to explore a limited area. However, it is recommended to start with, since it serves as a sort of tutorial to the open-world sandbox mode. This is the most popular mode, in which you are not confined to the plot and can discover new areas.</p>"

S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is set in Ukraine, in the infamous Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Several parts of the open-world setting were modeled after the real Chernobyl surroundings, including the power plant and the city of Pripyat, although designers took some liberties. The bleak environment and dark ambient music help to create an unsettling atmosphere of this place. <br />\nAccording to the backstory, in 2006, the second Chernobyl disaster occurred, turning the surrounding area into post-apocalyptic ruins, full of grotesque mutants and time-space anomalies. The &quot;stalkers&quot; in this world are the explorers who wander The Zone in search of valuable loot. You play as the Marked One, a stalker who lost his memory. All that remains of his past is a memo that says \u201cKill Strelok\u201d. The Marked One will have to learn more about himself, Strelok, The Zone, and its mysteries. The plot is non-linear, and there are multiple endings that depend on the quests you completed earlier.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Doki Doki Literature Club puts you into the role of an anime character, an average Japanese schoolboy. Your protagonist joins a literature club in which he&#39;s the only male member. The remaining four girls \u2013 Monica, Sayori, Natsuki, and Yuri \u2013 compete for the boy\u2019s attention. Each girl represents a certain anime character stereotype, such as tsundere, genki or kudere. As you get to know them closer, however, they turn out to have individual character traits on their own. Eventually, you will choose one of the girls to romance with and follow her personal storyline. The gameplay is based on interactions with the other characters and carefully choosing dialogue options. You will also perform tasks as a club member. The latter includes &quot;writing&quot; poetry, although the player actually only gets to select certain words to fill the blanks.<br />\nThe plot and dialogue are front and center in this game. The visuals and soundtrack, however, are static and minimalistic: the music is looped, and characters have a very limited number of sprites in each scene. There&#39;s no voice acting, and you only interact with characters through text.</p>"

The major events of the plot are set in the past, and we only learn about them through the voice of the unseen narrator - the only voice in the game \u2013 who will read a certain letter from his past when he approaches a certain place. The letters slowly unfurl the mystery around him as you visit various locations on an island: the lighthouse, the cave, and others. The world of Dear Esther is far from open, and you can only follow the restricted pathways.

The more staff hired - the more options does the player have while building the prison.</p>\n<p>It is advised to complete the game&#39;s campaign first which also serves as a tutorial and consists of 5 parts. Each part of the campaign focuses on two game aspects and has its&#39; own story told with Polaroid photos. The player can&#39;t lose the game in campaign mode as there are no failure conditions whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Two more modes are present: Sandbox Mode and Escape Mode. There is no main goal in Sandbox Mode, so you basically can&#39;t win the game, but there are several failure conditions such as a riot or bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>Escape Mode, on the other hand, has both winning and losing conditions. In this mode, you play as a prisoner making their escape causing the most destruction on your way out. Escape Mode starts automatically if you allow too many deaths in a short period of time in Sandbox Mode.</p>"

Races and racing championships are held in three main locations \u2013 the United States, Europe, and Japan. All racing circuits in the game are the mixture of imaginary and the existing ones. The gameplay is divided into 6 racing classes: GT championships, drifting, touge (climbing the narrow mountain pass like Pikes Peak), open wheel racing, demolition derby, and 24 Hours of Le Mans (additional at the end of the season). Each car of 43 available in the game is tied to one of the event types. Several professional teams compete within these championships. Therefore, to start the career player have to choose one of the disciplines and a professional team to join. While progressing GRID gives an opportunity to create your own racing team, hire sponsors and other drivers, and participate in different events. The gameplay also has a remarkable feature called \u201cflashback\u201d that allows rewinding time to prevent driver\u2019s mistakes.</p>"

Voices speaking the ancient Scandinavian languages, and beautiful original music help to create a tangible atmosphere of Nordic folklore and adventure.\u2028These advantages draw attention to the game, despite the lack of continuous action. There is no such action in the game, but when it does happen, its epic nature is suited to the world of Nordic fairy tales. Plots of these tales and a description of the world of Nordic myths are adequately represented in the game, it is even possible to study this topic. The gameplay consists of exploring large levels, searching for runes to enter the next level, avoiding various exotic troubles and rare but epic and picturesque battles.</p>"

Players control the protagonist as he climbs platforms, jumps on the enemies to defeat them and to collect keys to hidden quests and mosaic parts. Players have to lead Tim through 6 worlds, each based on an intriguing time mechanic, as Tim features the ability to rewind the original pace of time. For example, Time and Forgiveness world allows respawning Tim after his death by switching time back. To attend the last level, Tim must assemble the mosaic. The story ends in the world simply called \u201c1\u201d, where time flows in reverse and returns to the normal pace by rewinding. The last room of the final world contains Tim\u2019s meeting with the princess, but, due to the time pace turned back, players face some unpredictable twists of the plot.</p>"

Can be present everywhere and even pass through the walls (but not in closed houses, only through open doors and windows). Can see what ordinary people see, read, think.

Ways to extract proof are sometimes very exotic. For example, a hero can penetrate the memory of a witness and find there information that the witness himself cannot remember. The hero can meet other ghosts, who were once people and killed - after talking with them, you can learn about the circumstances of this.<br />\nFinding evidence and reasoning is not the only thing that you have to do. The hero can be killed a second time, and it will be definitive - some disembodied beings seek to destroy the hero&#39;s soul. But they are vulnerable, and the hero can kill them.</p>"

The series follows Sam Stone\u2019s adventures set in the environment of Egyptian pyramids, jungles and medieval castles. According to the plot, the protagonist fights against science-fictional extraterrestrial forces and their leader Mental, whose only aim is the devastation of humanity. The gameplay consists of eliminating waves of re-spawning invaders all across the game map. Enemies themselves range from basic soldiers to gigantic robots. As far as health and armor are non-regenerative, players controlling Sam have to gather special packs, which are scattered all around, in addition to dodging aliens\u2019 attacks. From the technical side remasters offer lots of graphical issues and fixtures. The 2017 Fusion also allows players to maneuver within the whole series not exiting the game.</p>"

Some levels are based on platforming only, while the others make you change the environment and solve puzzles. Some of them are based on the character\u2019s ability to turn into a ball and use both hands to hold tools.<br />\nAnd still, the key feature of Starbound is procedurally generated levels and their design.

The events depicted in the game do not correlate with those of a TV-show, but rather complement them with the in-between details.<br />\nThere is a total of five playable characters, the game like the other TellTale titles is made as the point-and-click adventure with high attention paid to the choices. The gameplay is formed of QTEs, dialogues, cutscenes and the investigation parts. QTEs are forcing a player to mash the buttons repeatedly, in the dialogues section one can choose options to answer, and the investigation part involves pointing-and-clicking on the objects.<br />\nAfter every episode, the player is given the information about his or her choices. On the same screen, one may compare own decisions to the preferences of the other players in the world.</p>"

It consists of seven mini-games for up to five players: Mini Robots (a hub), Monster Escape, Cat &amp; Mouse, Ghost House, Wanted!, Robot Rescue, and Toy Wars. In all these games players take control of tiny VR Bots. Players are offered to assume roles of robots, as the game follows their endless adventures including fights against gigantic monsters (in Monster Escape), the classic cat/mouse confrontation (in Cat &amp; Mouse), and rescuing other robots stranded somewhere (in Robot Rescue). Mini Robots, as a central hub for all actions, is a VR toybox simulator, which is a home for VR Bots. Actually, the game is set as if robots lead their own living being periodically interrupted by players. Playing other games will give coins that can be spent on the in-game toys. As far as all the games are in the same ecosystem, progressing in the other six games will impact the upgrades of robots\u2019 dwelling. Mini-games also feature the multiplayer mode for the game experience improvement.</p>"

They both search for the ways to escape the infested city. Companions, such as Ada Wong and Sherry, occasionally follow the protagonists. The characters eventually uncover the dark secrets of the Umbrella Corporation, which created the virus as a biological weapon, and fight its monsters, such as the Tyrant.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls either Leon or Claire from the third person view in a 3D environment. The two protagonists&#39; storylines are intertwined. The player can complete the scenario playing one of the protagonists, and then replay it from the other character&#39;s POV, with all his previous actions taken into account. The game combines puzzle solving with zombie fights. Both protagonists use firearms as their main weapon; however, ammo is scarce.</p>\n<h3>Changes from the original</h3>\n<p>Besides the updated graphics, the remake features a new camera and controls. In the original game, the controls were relative to the position of the player&#39;s character rather than the camera. The remake uses an over the shoulder camera, and the movements are relative to its angle. There&#39;s also no more loading screens, and the characters move between locations seamlessly.</p>"

Governments collapse and the infrastructure is almost non-existent. </p>\n<p>Up to 6 players spawn on the map in order to kill the boss. The players have to hold out 4, 7 or 10 waves of enemies after which the boss spawns. Each wave has more enemies and special mutants. After the end of a wave, the players can visit the trader, where they can buy weaponry and equipment. Players earn money and experience points for killing enemies. The more players there are on the map - the more enemies spawn. The difficulty level is also affected by the number of players. The only difference between singleplayer and multiplayer is in the number of players.</p>\n<p>The game features a class system. Players spawn with level 0 and can level themselves up to level 25. Each class is better in one field of combat. For example, medics have a speed boost and can heal other players while supports are able to seal the doors.</p>"

The action is set in a 3D fictionalized Tokyo torn by teen gangs clash. Things clarify when Professor K, DJ of the Tokyo-to pirate radio station announces a gang war between Japanese rudies (teenagers, who skate and paint graffiti for self-expression). According to the main idea, teens skate and paint graffiti spots throughout the city and dodge police forces. The story is following a 17-year-old rudie Beat, who, being inspired by Professor K, organizes his own gang to burst into the conflict and to defeat rivals. The gameplay is about skating across the city (using only a few buttons) and tagging all possible graffiti spots. In the course of the game, players will face troubles caused by police riots and especially Capitan Onishima (the main antagonist), whose only aim is to pursue the rebellion of the youth. Jet Set Radio also features cel-shaded visuals in favor of 3D cartoon-like picture.</p>"

From the athletic figure and the hoarse voice to short phrases that leave no doubt in the victory. He goes to the past, for it can return everything as it was.<br />\nThis type of hero sets everything else, the plot is clear and straightforward - run and shoot. It happens on twelve levels, the landscapes of which are created by Nature for bloody and dynamic battles. Everyone who likes to shoot and run will be happy with everything in this game. The best in the genre is collected in one place and cleaned to chemical purity. Even the monsters you meet as old friends - and they also try for you with all their might. They roar, beat and shoot, covering the sky.<br />\nThere are enough weapons in the game, including hand-to-hand combat skills. Separate pleasure - if you kill monsters by your hands, you need to find your own approach to each. One monster needs to be pulled out of the eye, the other will die only if you wrest the heart. The heart, by the way, can then be thrown in someone - it can kill. There are a lot of pleasant surprises of this kind in the game.</p>"

Nonetheless, unlike other MMOs, the game does not include communication with all of the server \u2014 just with the team that is matched for him or her. </p>\n<p>The game emphasizes PvE and PvP types of play the first one being divided into strikes and raids, while the latter is the typical FPS multiplayer type. Strikes are the quests played by three characters with the boss in the end. Raids, on the other hand, are story-related, implement six players and also contain boss in the end.</p>"

It is based on the first two films in Peter Jackson&#39;s The Hobbit film trilogy, that was, in turn, adapted from John R.R. Tolkien&#39;s book of the same name. Like with all LEGO games, its visual style imitates a world that is entirely made of LEGO constructions and inhabited by mini-figures.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game follows the plot of the movies rather than the original book. LEGO The Hobbit recreates The Hobbit story using voice samples from the movies, while also parodying it with the addition of the tongue-in-cheek humor. The plot takes place in the high fantasy world of Middle-Earth. Bilbo Baggins, the main protagonist, is a hobbit. He lived a peaceful life until one day a company of thirteen dwarves and the wizard named Gandalf called him to join them on an adventure. Bilbo and his new friends left out on a quest to reconquer the dwarves&#39; home, the Lonely Mountain, and its treasures from the wicked dragon Smaug. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls the Thorin&#39;s party, switching between characters when needed. Each character has his unique abilities, such as climbing or shooting arrows. The game is divided into a series of short, linear levels that correspond to certain scenes in the movies. On the way, the player has to smash objects made of LEGO and sometimes use them to assemble new objects. The game also has a cooperative multiplayer for two.</p>"

The action takes place in an imaginary universe shown in a 2.5D perspective. The gameplay is divided into two main storylines, so players are able to assume the roles of both Vella Tartine and Shay Volta. The game allows switching characters at any time. Firstly, events move players to Sugar Bunting town occupied by fictional monsters called Mogs, which demand a sacrifice of young girls every 14 years. Once the protagonist Vella finds herself chosen to be the sacrificed maiden. As she tries to stay alive, she realizes that the only way out is to fight the monster and to liberate her hometown. The second story tells about Shay, a lone boy imprisoned in a spaceship between two AI systems. The boy seeks independence and starts to explore the entire ship then moving to the whole war-torn galaxy. Both storylines are not expected to connect somehow, but in the course of completion game levels, players start to notice similar slight details.</p>"

The outside world reacts to the player&#39;s actions and changes under his/her influence. However, it will not only be necessary to explore the underwater world: ground fragments also come into play in the game. Despite the simplicity and serenity of the game, there are dangers in the form of sea predators.</p>\n<p>The story is told without a single word and the silence only helps to create a unique atmosphere of peace and tranquillity that reigns in the world of the game. The mosaic of the game setting is completed by the implementation of the game camera and the opportunity to look at the world through the eyes of fish - you need to enter the meditation mode for this.</p>"

The main storyline is divided into four parts: the first three follow the characters, while the last one is played for the police side. To start another \u201cbig score\u201d players have to select one of eight available characters. Each character has different skills and special abilities, so the squad should be appropriately chosen in advance. From the very beginning, players are able to assume the roles of four criminals: the Locksmith, the Cleaner, the Lookout, and the Pickpocket. The remaining four \u2013 the Mole, the Gentleman, the Redhead, and the Hacker \u2013 will be unlocked during the further game progress. The gameplay is about completing levels in multiple ways depending on the players\u2019 character choice. Monaco: What\u2019s Yours Is Mine gives an opportunity to dive into the crime world and participate in heists and robberies throughout the world alone or in co-operation up to four players.</p>"

Rebellious clone soldiers are capable of even cannibalism, and other details of the setting correspond to this level of fear.<br />\nProtagonists and antagonists have unusual abilities or conventional abilities, developed to an unusually high level. This is manifested, among other things, in the possession of ghostly forms, by which it is possible to mislead other people.</p>\n<p>The game is strictly from the first person. A notable feature of the gameplay is the slow motion mode. In this mode, the player accelerates the perception to such an extent that it can see the flying bullets. This gives him obvious advantages. The slow motion mode, in the game, is explained by the increased content of adrenaline in the blood, which occurs in a person, in a situation that threatens life. If this condition is caused in a natural way, then it does not last long. It can be extended with the help of a special drug, which is included in the number of useful game stuff. Sometimes this mode is &quot;turned on&quot; during visions that visit the hero and act on him as much as the danger.</p>"

The title serves as a spin-off to Tomb Raider series and is not connected to the series storyline whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Two thousand years ago there was a battle between the Guardian of Light and the Keeper of Darkness. The Keeper won using the Mirror of Smoke with which he summoned a horde of horrible monsters, but the Guardian survived the encounter and imprisoned the Keeper in his own mirror. Fast-forward to the present day. Lara Croft finds the legendary mirror, but she does not know what evil it contains. </p>\n<p>The game puts a strong emphasis on cooperative play, yet it is possible to complete the game alone. While the previous installments in the series featured an action third-person camera, Guardian of Light is using a fixed isometric camera. The players can choose to play either as the Guardian himself or as Lara Croft with each character having their own abilities.</p>\n<p>Puzzles differ when played alone or in co-op mode. This was done in order to make the players rely less on AI.</p>"

The game is set in the open-world environment of fictional Harran city. Players are offered to assume the role of an undercover agent Kyle Crane who has been sent in the quarantine zone. His mission is to find the rogue politician Kadir &quot;Rais&quot; Suleiman lost somewhere in the infected giant city. On the way to achieving the goal, Kyle will meet other survivors, who desperately try to stay alive among zombies. The chief game mechanic is running the generators and turning on streetlights throughout Harran to make another part of the map accessible and safe at nighttime. The game features day/night time cycles that change the game remarkably: the action becomes fast-paced, and all the infected people turn into dangerous zombies. Therefore, the gameplay is based on armed combat against mutants and Kyle\u2019s sneak and parkour skill for preventing it.</p>"

The smith can sell weapons and armour, and the gipsy can sell different magic things. A meeting with an architect can help with the exploration and reconstruction of the castle. The study of the castle promises useful finds. Among other spaces of the game are a forest, a dungeon and a tower.<br />\nAt the disposal of the player, there is a book in which all the messages encountered during the game are collected. Messages inform us about what is there and what is happening.<br />\nThe map is always generated anew and randomly, and the hero always dies at the end of the game, but all of his money is saved, and they can improve the character of the new game. The gameplay consists of searching and developing strengths and things, battling with opponents and finally - killing the main boss.</p>"

The game has a minimum of hints, and puzzle solving is often very unobvious.<br />\nThe plot of the game moves forward with the actions of the main character - Rufus, who lives on the planet of Deponia, long ago turned into a dump. Rufus dreams of moving to Elysium - a planet where life is entirely different.<br />\nHe calls himself an inventor, but his ability to invent is very doubtful, like his successes in life in general. He lives in the home of his ex-girlfriend and does not do anything useful. Nevertheless, one day he manages to get on the ship of the organisation &quot;Organnon&quot;, to get on Elysium. He meets on this ship a girl from Elysium, but when trying to protect her in a conflict with the owners of the ship accidentally pushes her off the ship. The girl flies down and falls on Deponia. Then the intrigue begins, the locals build their plans for the girl, and Rufus returns to Deponia and, as it turns out, has romantic feelings for the girl (and still wants to get to Elysium). In all this takes part the mayor of the city and many other residents, as well as robots. The girl herself lost her memory of the fall, and the members of the Organnon have an intention to blow up Deponia.</p>"

The game offers action racing that sometimes resembles the demolition derby in an open-world setting of Paradise City. The game has a remarkable damage system that improves the whole experience and interrupts monotonous moves across the city, which is free-to-explore for the first time in a series. With The Ultimate Box edition, developers added day/night time cycles and dynamic weather system, so graphics became much better. Changes also affected the gameplay. Now players can race and explore the entire map of the city either by car or by bike that were also added. The racing career begins at the dump, where the driver, controlled by players, gets their first car and two new bikes. Players complete races and fill the \u201cdriving license\u201d scale to upgrade the level and to open new cars and events. The free roam mode itself is also an integral part of the gameplay: while traveling across the map drivers are able to perform various stunts and unlock special achievements for the \u201clicense\u201d experience.</p>"

The game focuses on the obscure battles of the war. It features storylines that tie the battles together and consist of episodes called \u201cwar stories\u201d.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Battlefield V puts a strong emphasis on realism. The game avoids video game abstractions in favor of immersive experience of the war. For that goal, the game aims to increase the player&#39;s interaction with the environment, such as doors, vehicles, or ammo. The ammo and other resources in the game are scarce, forcing the player to use a tactical approach.<br />\nThe game gives a spotlight to women in the military who are among the main characters in the campaign. The player might also choose to play a female character in the multiplayer, as the gender is not tied to a class. The game also allows the players many customization options for costumes, vehicles, and weapons.</p>\n<h3>Modes</h3>\n<p>Battlefield V has many multiplayer modes, some of which are new to the series and some are reimagined versions of the modes from previous games. For example, The Grand Operations mode is based on the original Battlefield mode called Operations. This mode imitates a military campaign and consists of a series of battles with different objectives and non-linear progress options.</p>"

The only similar thing that relates Showdown to the original games is a high level of graphics: developers added day/night time cycles and dynamic weather system, so the whole picture looks beautiful. This game offers an arcade physics that focus players on their positive emotions. Even the advanced damage system is only a cosmetic feature because damages don\u2019t really affect car running performance. Everything in the game is made for the spectacle. The vehicle range was expanded: imaginary monsters specially prepared for the demolition were added to already existing licensed rally cars. Racing experience covers picturesque landscapes throughout America. All the events can be divided into four main classes (Racing, Demolition, Hoonigan, and Party) and then into numerous types. Gradual completion of the events gives money for buying new vehicles or upgrading existing ones and opens new perspectives for drivers. DiRT Showdown offers both single and multiplayer experience.</p>"

It is the thirteenth game in the Medal of Honor franchise, but in comparison to the previous ones, its plot is unique. The game is set in the historical period of the War in Afghanistan. The single campaign opens up in 2001 during the invasion of Afghanistan. The action gives an opportunity to participate in the military conflict for the U.S. Navy. In the course of the storyline, players alternate between the roles of a Navy SEAL operator codenamed Rabbit, Delta Force sniper Deuce, U.S. Army Ranger specialist Dante Adams, and AH-64 Apache gunner Hawk. The gameplay is based on typical military operations including the completion of in-game objectives (raiding enemies\u2019 checkpoints and rescuing hostages). Medal of Honor multiplayer offers a choice of joining one of the conflict\u2019s forces: the Coalition or the Opposing Forces. Each side has its own weapons, however, comparable in general stats. To start a match, the player should choose a class (Rifleman, Special Ops or Sniper). Classes\u2019 equipment and skills can be upgraded with the experience points earned in combat.</p>"

The game is a remake of Day Of Defeat which was released on GoldSrc engine.</p>\n<p>Set in 1944, the game focuses on the European war theatre and two teams: U.S. Army and Vermacht. Each team has 6 player classes: Rifleman, Assault, Support, Machinegunner, and Rocket.</p>\n<p>DoD: Source features two game modes: territorial control and detonation. In territorial control, players fight over several strategic points on the map. In detonation, however, the objective is to detonate two bombs on every checkpoint of the opposing team.</p>\n<p>The game features 8 official maps, but there are a lot of custom maps designed by the community members.</p>\n<p>Day Of Defeat: Source served as a testing ground for Valve as it was the first Source-based game that featured in-engine High Dynamic Range. Several post-processing effects were added by Valve after the release of the game in order to make it look more like a 1940s era movie. The effects include film grain, color correction and depth of field.</p>"

The game is set in noir tones, providing with main character\u2019s monologues and various cutscenes.<br />\nThe titular protagonist, Max Payne, is a traumatized officer of the police. After the first game\u2019s events, Max is once again involved in the bloody conflicts of the mafia, with its drama, romance, and bitterness. The game offers its players various game mechanics for maximum replayability. For instance, the difficulty of each level adapts to how you play overall, with enemies dealing less damage and painkillers being more effective if the player has died too many times. The series\u2019s feature mechanic, Bullet Time, is also present in the game, allowing players to plan their movements and save precious ammunition during the slowed time. <br />\nThe game\u2019s physics engine allows the players to experience the most fearsome battles hand-to-hand, with the realistic destruction of surroundings, cinematographic kills, and dramatic deaths. Max Payne 2 also features a game editor, with user-created modifications serving as a tool to further enhance every playthrough.</p>"

The game follows a female astronaut stranded on the abandoned space research station in a science-fictional universe. Completing the game players will be able to learn more about the fate of researches and to restore the sequence of events held aboard the station. Players assume the role of the protagonist, as she tries to clarify the mystery of a unique item, which allows her to clone herself and to transfer the mind to the clone. Therefore, the cloning ability is a basic game mechanic that helps the player to solve puzzles and complete levels. The gameplay features traditional side-scrolling platformers\u2019 elements: players control the 2D action from the third-person perspective. In the course of the completion, players are going to face obstacles of varying degrees of complexity ranging from simple barriers (however inaccessible for clones) to higher platforms or even gravity shutdowns.</p>"

The studio successfully raised funds for development in 2014 at Kickstarter and released the project in the same year. Only two people worked on the game: they just graduated from college and had some experience developing game mods. The game uses the Unity graphics engine and is available on Steam for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and OS X.</p>\n<h3>Game mechanics</h3>\n<p>There are no conditions for victory or defeat in the game. Each time players simply spawn on the playing field, where they can interact freely with game figures and pieces. All the craziness occurs within the realistic physical model, which the developers have added for greater similarity to the real prototypes. In addition to the insanity that can be arranged in multiplayer along with ten other players, the game engine supports the ability to use preset rules for different board games and thus play them.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>There are several games included. For example, chess, poker, and checkers. The set is small, but the game supports Steam Workshop and the ability to download your own models of figures and game boards. Thus, players added to the standard set of three games three thousand more variations, most of which are variations on games, for the inclusion of which developers will have to purchase a license.</p>"

        "description": "<h3>The restart</h3>\n<p>Released in 2016, the remastered version of one of the most revolutionary parts of the annual Call of Duty series. In 2007, the series moved from historical scenery to modern, got a new more advanced graphics thanks to the freshly-released consoles and presented to the players a hardcore fast-paced multiplayer. The latter is still wanted by hardcore fans, which gave the publisher Activision Blizzard a reason to remaster the game.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>In the new version, developers from the Raven Software did their best to rebuild the experience (the original game was developed by Infinity Ward). The game is available for purchase, as a separate product, and as part of a bundle. Owners of the original version of the game can get Remastered for free - you need to have the original disk for this or digital purchase. The re-released game did not change the gameplay in any way: it is still a fast-paced first-person shooter. The story campaign, during which the player takes control of several characters, also has not changed. Most of the changes turned out to be cosmetic and allowed the new studio to add new technologies to the original game: for example, while prone and moving, the weapon touching the ground will vibrate the controller. Also in the single-player campaign, new cheat codes were added, such as exaggerated physics and the ability to replace heads on the shoulders of virtual people with watermelons.</p>\n<h3>The changes</h3>\n<p>The main changes lie in multiplayer, which pulled up to the standard of modern games of the series. In place, there were the same modes, the same weapons, and perks. Added new ones, like the Prop Hunt mode, in which players turn into nonliving objects and hide on the map. New content is available as the challenges unfold.</p>"

But one madman from Tokyo began to produce robots that do not know that they are robots - and this can be understood because they look and behave exactly like people. This is a violation of the law, and the team of pros from different countries flies to Japan to forever stop the conveyor of the insane inventor. Robots with problems of self-identification can provide a variety for those fans of tactical shooters who are tired of terrorists and zombies.<br />\nThe game has visually attractive features. The style of opponents, the style of equipping the team of heroes are very attractive and original. Some details of the battles are well presented - bullets knock out picturesque clouds of debris. Locations are less expressive - apparently, so as not to interfere with focusing on the actual combat. A notable feature of the gameplay is the dependence of the relationship in the team on the player&#39;s actions. If the team has bad mutual support - lower trust, lower trust - lower effectiveness in combat.</p>"

However, the scavenger by mistake sucks the cleaner Joseph (you play as him). And the bandit washes off, kidnaping Joseph&#39;s girlfriend, Berta. From this moment the game begins. </p>\n<p>The most significant difference from other games made in this genre is that the interaction occurs only with those objects that the protagonist can reach. You can also increase and decrease your height (three positions: low standard and high).

The game follows traditions of the cosmic opera genre and features interstellar travel, space fights, and interaction with various alien races. Mass Effect 3 heavily focuses on combat; the core is shooting with a cover system and pursuits.<br />\nYou play as Commander Shepard (who can rather be male or female) during his fight against the race of Reapers, that invades Earth. The only hope of the world is the absolute weapon you have to create with the help of all races. The tone of the series switched to more pessimistic compared to previous games. Your actions may lead to the deaths of your friends, and this makes your choices harder.\u00a0<br />\nThe game is followed by Mass Effect: Andromeda, however, this installment is not a direct sequel to the trilogy and follows the story of brand new characters.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is a first standalone and the third overall DLC to the original Sins of a Solar Empire title. It is also a strategy set in space with the science-fiction lore.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The point of the game is to conquer as many planets as possible using the given resources. The protagonist can be chosen out of three races: industrials, aliens and psychics each with unique special abilities.<br />\nThe gameplay process occurs exclusively in online mode, but single battles and succeeds against enemy AI is possible too. However, the campaign as a whole cannot be played offline. </p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>As in usual RTS, the gameplay is centered around resource management \u2014 the title&#39;s economy consists of prices on Metal, Credits, and Crystal \u2014 each with the individual gain conditions. So it would be impossible for instance to sell all of your metal to the friendly guild \u2014 after the wholesale, stock prices decrease and economy shifts towards them like real-life one.<br />\nWhile exploring the world, the player may stumble across habitable planets and anomalies which prevent the player from getting to the goal. Anomalies include asteroids, hostile environment, and ice fields.</p>\n<h3>Rebellion DLC</h3>\n<p>The expansion adds two new units into the gams: Loyalist and Rebel \u2014 delegates of any races can choose between them. A graphical engine was updated as well.</p>"

However, the war between magic schools broke out after that. Most of the wizards passed away. Humanity entered a Golden Age without the mages destroying the human&#39;s way of life. During this period a prophecy of a child that would make Midgard a better place emerges. The prophecy also told that the evil forces will oppose the child. Mages set out on a quest to save the child.</p>\n<p>The game could be played alone or in a cooperative mode with up to four players. Unlike most role-playing games, Magicka 2 does not feature any class system. Every character is armed with a staff and a melee weapon.</p>\n<p>Magicka 2 features a high degree of satire and a lot of references to other games. For example, one of the weapons the player can use is the Excalibur or the M60 machine gun crafted by a local blacksmith from a string and a shotgun. The main feature of the game is the dynamic spellcasting system that allows combining 8 elementals in order for the player to choose their own playstyle.</p>"

The variety of levels includes PBY missions, sniper tasks, and sea battles.\u00a0<br />\nWorld at War is the first game of the franchise to introduce Nazi Zombies mode - a cooperative mini-game where 2 to 4 players fight endless hordes of zombies.

The setting was inspired by a Russian sci-fi book Roadside Picnic and its adaptation Stalker. Scar, the main character of Clear Sky, is a stalker, which in this world is a term for guides and explorers in The Zone. He was hit by an energy beam that gave him a superhuman ability to survive The Zone\u2019s phenomena. Scar joins the Clear Sky, a secret science organization that studies The Zone\u2019s anomalies. Strelok, an important character from the previous game, appears as the main antagonist. <br />\nLike its predecessor, Clear Sky is a combination of first-person shooter gameplay with RPG mechanics like skills, leveling up, dialogue, and inventory. The player is free to explore the open world and accept quests unrelated to the central plot from various NPCs and factions. Compared to Shadow of Chernobyl, the prequel has improved graphics, additional options for customization and equipment repair and a complete day/night cycle.</p>"

The game features two story-oriented modes: Character Story and A Shadow Falls. In Character Story you can choose any character to go through a series of fights. It starts with a prologue and finishes with ending unique for each character. At launch only, Characters Story was available while A Shadow Falls, a full-fledged story mode that describes a battle between World Fighters and criminal syndicate Shandaloo was added later in July 2016.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Like its predecessors, Street Fighter is a 2D one-on-one fighting game. The initial characters roster included 16 characters four of which were newcomers to the series. Since the game release, many more characters were added with DLC making roster more than twice as big as it was on launch. The core gameplay shares many similarities with Street Fighter IV. However, it abandons Focus Mode and Ultra Combos introduce in that game. The main new mechanic in Street Fighter V is V-Skills system. V-Skill is special moves, unique for every character. Using these moves helps to fill V-Gauge which can be used to perform V-Reversals, special counter-attacks, or V-Trigger especially powerful abilities that require the full gauge.</p>"

The game field is made out of several floating platforms which the players can jump on by stepping on one of the arrows on the edge of the platform.</p>\n<p>The objective is to push other players off the platforms using throwing discs - the only weapon present in the game. The player can&#39;t have more than 3 discs at the same time. The platforms are limited by a horizontal strip that can be used for ricocheting the discs. For pushing the player off with a direct hit, 1 point is scored. 2 for pushing the player off with a ricochet and 3 for double ricochet.</p>\n<p>There are two firing modes: single disc shot and the beheading shot that uses all three discs at once. </p>\n<p>In comparison to other Half-Life mods, the number of deaths is not tracked by in-game statistics. Overall, this mod is much more primitive than the others. Only 2D targeting is present and the player movement comes down to jumping from platform to platform.</p>"

They aim to search for survivors or, if needed, to destroy the colony to prevent the spread of hostile aliens. After finding no civilians alive, the group realizes that the only way out is planet devastation with a powerful nuclear bomb. The main gameplay idea is in completing levels in science-fictional locations and eliminating waves of Swarm aliens with all kinds of weapons to get new equipment and to unlock individual achievements. As the game is class-based, players are able to choose between 4 types: Officer, Special Weapons, Medic, and Tech. Each type has two characters with different abilities. The whole loadout can also be selected before starting the mission. The game is absolutely free-of-charge and offers both single and co-operative (up to 4 players) experience.</p>"

For instance, the iconic Half-Life crowbar is used instead of Quake&#39;s axe.</p>\n<p>Deathmatch Classic physics is similar to Quake and allows the players to traverse at high speeds using bunnyhopping because of game engines similarities. However, the game speed in Deathmatch Classic is slower than in Quake. </p>\n<p>There is no loadout system in the game, so the players have to pick up weapons that are scattered across the map and vary from the default shotgun to a rocket launcher, a taser, and a powerful beam weaponry. </p>\n<p>There are also three kinds of bonuses in the game which grant players special abilities such as invincibility, invisibility or quad damage for a short amount of time.</p>"

You, as Jimmy, walk around an open world of Bullworth Academy and its surroundings, finding new optional missions that may get you into trouble and fun at the same time. You can pick fights with other hooligans, fire at your schoolmates with a slingshot, drop stink bombs, ride a skateboard, and break into others\u2019 lockers, as long as you don\u2019t get caught by the teachers. You will also attend classes and perform exercises, which are rendered as mini-games. A smaller world, compared to GTA, means fewer characters, but each major character is interactive, fleshed out, and unique. The characters are split between several factions, or \u201ccliques\u201d, and Jimmy will have to complete specific missions to earn their respect. Completed tasks will also provide Jimmy with trophies that he will store in his room to commemorate his successes.</p>"

        "description": "<p>The game is set in the distant future of 2114, 42 years after the events of the original System Shock. We are onboard the spaceship Von Braun that returns from humanity&#39;s first interstellar expedition to Tau Ceti system. The plot follows the main character who awakens from the cryosleep, with no idea what&#39;s going on. The rest of the crew was affected by some disaster that either killed them or turned into brainwashed slaves of an alien entity called The Many. The only other survivor is presumed to be mysterious Dr. Janice Polito, who instructs the player via radio. To survive and find out what happened, the protagonist sets out to explore the dimly lit corridors of Von Braun, encountering his former friends mutated into abominations. The player can use guns, but ammunition is scarce, which forces the player to use it prudently and move ahead with caution.</p>\n<p>The game was created by Ken Levine, the Irrational Games founder and famous designer behind such titles as BioShock and Thief: The Dark Project. System Shock series was a major inspiration for Bioshock series, which is considered its spiritual successor, as well as, to some extent, Portal series.</p>"

Magic and technology co-exist in this setting, dragons are real, as well as elves, goblins, dwarves and many other mythological creatures, but they are living in a future world full of hackers and megacorporations. The &quot;shadowrunners&quot; are specialists who perform all sorts of dirty jobs for syndicates and governments. This setting was originally designed for the tabletop games, but since 1990s Shadowrun is also a popular game series, in which Dragonfall is the sixth installment. In Dragonfall, you control a team of shadowrunners, led by your protagonist, in an isometric view. While hacking a data vault in Berlin, your party discovers dangerous secrets that were better left unknown. The characters in your team are highly developed, have backstories and inspire sympathy. To avoid losing your favorite companion, you will have to plan your battles prudently.<br />\nDragonfall was originally a DLC released to support the previous part, Shadowrun Returns. Compared to the standard edition, &quot;Director&#39;s Cut&quot; includes five additional missions, several alternate endings, an improved interface design, a slightly different combat system and a new soundtrack composed by Jon Everist.</p>"

A lot of features, not present in the single-player campaign, will be available to the player, such as a killstreak mechanic, that rewards players for killing multiple enemies without dying. Multiplayer maps consist of team-based and deathmatch based game modes, where players take on the objectives in order to complete the map mission or to obtain the largest amount of kills. Depending on how well the player does, they will be rewarded with experience points, which will allow them to level up and unlock new weapons, abilities, and perks for the playable classes.</p>"

However, the storyline offers much more beyond that, allowing players to discover the secrets of Midgar, and eventually, save the world.<br />\nFinal Fantasy VII follows the trend set by previous games of the series, offering a grand world map to explore, with unique locations and lengthy battles. The combat system is a trademark for the genre and the series, where the player\u2019s team and the enemies trade blow in a turn-based manner, employing different skills and items until either side is defeated. The game\u2019s art style is innovative for a Final Fantasy, as it uses 3D models over 2D backgrounds, resulting in a unique and memorable art style.</p>"

The game follows a former park ranger Randall Wayne, who tries to get to a safe zone located in the city, where he hopes his family will be waiting for him. Thus, he has to move across Seattle to reach his final destination. On his way, Randall, in control of players, should avoid both zombies and members of self-proclaimed local authority gang called New Law. The game is made in a cinematic manner to transfer the zombie apocalypse atmosphere correctly. The gameplay is divided into levels and consists of walking through platforms and solving puzzles. Players can use Randall\u2019s ability to entrap zombies by luring them into environmental hazards, and other mechanics of running, creeping and climbing obstacles to bypass enemies. Although the protagonist has many hostiles, combat is unavoidable in only a few situations. However, the game features some melee weapons with extremely limited ammunition, so the fight is going to be tough.</p>"

They all follow Spyro, a small cutesy purple dragon, on his quest to save his dragon kin from various villains.</p>\n<p>The games are set in the Dragon Kingdom, a fantasy world inhabited by sentient dragons. There are five dragon realms that used to co-exist peacefully. In the first game, the villain is Gnasty Gnorc (a gnome/orc half-blood), who magically turned all dragons into crystals. Spyro has to save them and defeat Gnorc. In the sequels, Spyro has to deal with other villains, such as Ripto the warlock, who tries to conquer the world, or Sorceress, who steals the dragons&#39; eggs.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Spyro in a 3D environment from the third person view. Spyro can breathe fire to defeat his enemies. The dragon cannot actually fly, but he can glide long distances. A dragonfly companion named Sparx follows Spyro, helping him to pick up treasures and keep track of his health. To restore his health, Spyro can eat butterflies. The third game, Year of the Dragon, introduces other playable characters that can be unlocked by completing levels.</p>"

Matches are divided into rounds and, to win a match, a team has to score three round victories. Each round has a two-minute time limit, so as to push players toward a fast-paced gameplay.

He is tasked with eliminating colonel Arkady Kirilenko, the leader of a secret project that is about to produce a Russian superweapon that can be used to defeat the US once and for all. The rest of Bravo-2 is computer-controlled. The NPC will assist the player and are technically immortal; however, they cannot complete missions without player&#39;s actions.<br />\nWhile most of the time you play as infantry, there are certain stages where players can drive tanks, helicopters, gun turrets and other vehicles. One of the most distinctive features of the game&#39;s Frostbite engine is that all elements of the environment are fully destructible. Besides plot-driven single-player campaign, there&#39;s also multiplayer that allows five different modes. All characters are divided into four classes: Assault, Engineer, Medic, and Recon. Medics, in particular, can speed up the health regeneration; however, lost hit points are slowly restored by themselves.</p>"

The point of the game is to find all of the notes and progress through the plot, but collecting all the items is not necessary \u2014 it is nonetheless recommended to assemble them all to recollect the 1959 events. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is mostly about exploring and uncovering the mystery behind the death of the hike participators. There are some jump-scares involved. The gameplay centers around walking and hiding from The Shadows of the dead students\u2014 the only hostile characters in the game. With the absence of jumping ability, the protagonist has quite a few exploring tricks at their disposal. The game is strictly linear giving, however, with the ability to replay the main plot, collecting every possible note. </p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>Kholat is often considered to have atmospheric and immersive experience thanks to Shaun Bin voiceover and the unique soundtrack; all of the above is considered as a softening factor for the games various flaws: a bunch of invisible walls, optimization issues and no narrative as a whole.</p>"

One of the Sisters controlled the Light of the Sun, and the other - the Darkness of the Moon. The sisters lost the battle, and the hero imprisoned them. The shaman sees that a person with visions is an incarnation of the hero, and visions can mean that the Sisters managed to escape from prison.

There&#39;s no storyline in the game; in fact, it&#39;s an endless process of beating more and more powerful enemies, progress and get better heroes. There are microtransactions in the game; however, they don&#39;t affect your progress through the game.\u00a0<br />\nThe upgrade system is set around the in-game currency called hero souls that you can use to buy so-called Ancients that buff your stats. Hero souls drop from bosses you can beat on every fifth and tenth level. The key feature of the game is the way it uses hero souls to reset the game. Every time you want to upgrade Ancients and get more bonuses, you need to use a special ability that makes you start the game over. While you need to complete the levels and develop the heroes again, Ancients\u2019 bonuses remain and let you progress faster.<br />\nClicker Heroes is followed by Clicker Heroes 2 that is currently in Steam Early Access. Unlike its free-to-play predecessor, the sequel uses a buy-to-play model instead of micro-transaction</p>"

In his investigation, the journalist tries to find out why did Jin&#39;s grandfather kill his own wife and threw his son Kazuya down the cliff. At the same time, Jin goes into hiding after defeating an ancient demon named Azazel while his grandfather takes over Mishima Zaibatsu. The world war goes on.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Just like the previous games in the series (apart from Tekken Tag Tournament 1 &amp; 2), Tekken 7&#39;s gameplay revolves around one-on-one hand-to-hand fights. </p>\n<p>Players are free to choose one of 43 playable characters. Every character has their own personal list of attacks and combos and drastically differs in play style.</p>\n<p>Several new additions were made to the game&#39;s combat system. Players can now use devastating hits that will take from 40 to 80 percent of the enemy&#39;s health if the player&#39;s health drops too low. Moreover, the players are able to use a Rage Drive. It allows for performing a special hit on a high speed that inflicts major damage to the enemy. The last new addition is Power Crush. This feature lets the players attack their opponent even when they&#39;re under attack. Players can&#39;t block their enemies low kicks while using the Power Crush.</p>"

On a distant planet known as Shear, the humans are met with heavy alien resistance. William Cabot gets out of retirement to evacuate the colonists and assembles a team of Hunters in order to assist him in this.</p>\n<p>Evolve Stage 2 is focused on asymmetric co-operative and competitive multiplayer. There are 5 players in a match, 4 of which are the Hunters. The Hunters have limited time to find the Monster, while the latter has to evolve and grow stronger. The Monster is given a 30-second advantage over the Hunters in order to escape and hide somewhere on the map. </p>\n<p>Evolve Stage 2 features a class system with 4 classes present in the game. It is not possible for multiple players to use the same class in the match. Classes differ in their abilities and weapons. The same goes for the Monsters as there are five Monsters featured in the game. In contrast to the Hunters which are controlled from a first-person perspective, the game switches to a third-person camera while playing as a Monster.</p>"

The area of \u200b\u200bthe safe territory is continuously decreasing, and players must always move along and collect weapons, supplies and kill other players. The main task is to remain the last survivor. Thanks to the parody format, players have a much more extensive selection of weapons, for example, dual-wielding frying pans, and the animation of the characters&#39; movement is intentionally exaggerated.</p>\n<p>The first 100 hours after the release the game was available for free, but soon developers set $ 5 price tag. For developers, this is still a side project. All their focus goes to the main projects such as entirely Accurate Battle Simulator and Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator.</p>"

This is where players are dropped into the randomly generated map and from now on it\u2019s up for them to find resources to defend and feed themselves. <br />\n7 Days to Die is a voxel-based survival game, which means that building is simple and environments are destructible. Gathered and found objects are degrading through use, so it forces players into the constant search for better equipment. The name of the game hints at the horde mechanic, where every seventh day a large group of zombies is swarming the players&#39; location. Players will be killed in that case, unless preparations for the attack are sufficient enough. The game supports multiplayer, where other players can connect to the game server and be cooperative or hostile towards each other.</p>"

The mouse is used to move your hand up and down.<br />\nAs these controls aren&#39;t easy to master, it&#39;s quite hard to carry on the first operations. But the game starts to challenge you from the beginning, offering to operate a patient&#39;s heart, brains, and other important organs. The game&#39;s physics model reacts on every mistake you make with blood rivers and a patient&#39;s death. Because of this Surgeon Simulator became a meme among gamers with videos of its playthroughs gaining thousands of views.</p>"

The Boss is taken by Satan to Hell in order to marry Satan\u2019s daughter Jezebel. Saints lieutenants Johnny Gat and Kinzie Kensington follow them to rescue The Boss. You can play as one of the lieutenants.<br />\nThe game is set in an open world of New Hades, consisting of five islands, that you can explore flying around. This world is full of side quests, collectibles and other activities that you need to complete to progress through the story. While you can\u2019t customize your character, you obtain superpowers, including summoning demons to support you during the battle, magic aura to confuse enemies, and demon weapons. The core gameplay is third-person shooting but with a twist: instead of bullets your new guns will shoot with explosive toads and locust.<br />\nIn general, Gat Out of Hell follows the spirit of the franchise, supporting its fast pace and absurd tone that turns another mafia game in a colorful burlesque.</p>"

He is provided with ammunition - he picks them up from the corpses of killed enemies, ably uses shelters, can run, climb, jump, kill with one blow and fight in hand-to-hand combat.<br />\nIn Uncharted 2 you can find 101 treasures. Some treasures lie almost in sight, others will have to run. Treasures can be sold, and money can be spent on bonus content. Multiplayer mode allows you to play up to 3 people at a time - this is if players follow the adventure story of the game and solve problems together.

The players, who can team up in groups of up to four, are tasked with cleaning the streets from the dirty invaders. There are thirteen levels with different objectives, some of which involve collecting certain items or protecting a city well from being poisoned.<br />\nThe gameplay is strongly reminiscent of that in Left 4 Dead series, in which the protagonists have to slaughter monsters coming in large numbers, using both melee and ranged weapons. There are five character classes, each with its unique specialization: the Dwarf Ranger and the Empire Soldier are strong and slow, the Witch Hunter and the Waywatcher are the fast scouts, and the Bright Wizard uses magic. On the levels, the players can find item perks that either restore health or ammo or buff the character. It is essential to fairly distribute the perks across the party, especially since every player can only have one perk in each category at a time.</p>"

The game is accompanied by a synthwave soundtrack recorded by several popular electronic artists including Carpenter Brut.<br />\nThe player assumes the role of the Stranger, a white-haired samurai wearing a red cloak. The Stranger was kept as a prisoner on an orbital station until he was released from his cell by an unknown benefactor wearing a bunny suit. The protagonist, now armed with a plasma gun and a katana, has to fight his way to freedom through a series of levels, each of them containing only one enemy, a boss who guards Stranger&#39;s prison. Each battle is preceded by a cutscene that further reveals the plot, and each boss requires a unique approach.<br />\nThe game is played in an isometric top-down view. The combat system is very simple, it includes no combos and consists of only four basic movements. The Stranger can slash with his sword, fire his gun, block an incoming attack or dash forward to avoid it. Each action can be made more powerful by holding its button for several seconds, although it slows down your movement.</p>"

The player assumes the role of US special forces operative Karl Fairburne. His task is to eliminate the Nazi German general Franz Vahlen before he completes his project of a doomsday weapon. The locations and background events are inspired by the real historical places and battles.<br />\nThe gameplay is strongly oriented towards stealth action. Your protagonist is a talented marksman who can use a variety of sniper rifles. Finding a perfect spot to snipe from is as important as changing it, since you cannot hold one position for too long without being detected. Fairburne\u2019s condition and the environment influence his accuracy; for example, he cannot shoot straight after running or against the wind. A unique targeting system allows you to see where your bullet will hit the enemy\u2019s body or a vehicle and the amount of damage it can deal. Fairburne can also use other types of guns, as well as explosives. Kills earn the player the points that push your character towards higher ranks. Besides the story mode, there\u2019s a co-op mode and five multiplayer modes, including the classic deathmatch and \u201ccapture the flag\u201d.</p>"

There is also a team deathmatch option for groups of two to five.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of each match, all players are dropped randomly across the map. Before they start killing each other, they have to find themselves weapons, armor, and other necessary supplies. They may even use cars and bikes found in the game area to move faster or run down their opponents. Crafting is also available, and players can use items they gathered to make improvised armor and weapons. </p>\n<p>Some players may decide to stay out of the fight for as long as possible to let their opponents eliminate each other. They can not bide their time forever, though: to prevent players from camping for too long, the game area will shrink over time. Poisoned gas will eventually cover larger and larger sections of the map, forcing the players to come together at last and indulge in the good old ultraviolence. The masks and hilarious motley outfits worn by the characters not only make them look unique but also bring into H1Z1 a distinct flavor of The Purge film series.</p>"

Like its predecessor, it is based around parkour simulation.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game is set in the near future that is depicted as a cyberpunk dystopia. The story takes place in the city of Glass that is ruled by mega-corporations. Faith, the protagonist of the original game, returns in Catalyst. She is a Runner, a person who specializes in illegal delivery. Early in the game, Faith steals a valuable hard drive from a corporation. After reading its data, she learns about the Reflection project that will allow the corporations to control every resident in Glass.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game combines platforming, parkour, and puzzles in the vein of Portal series. The player controls Faith from the first person view as she runs and leaps across the rooftops of Glass. Puzzle-like level design requires her to use pipes, wires, and ledges to get to her destination. Precision timing is important to perform jumps, slides, and rushes in a seamless flow.</p>\n<p>The combat system in Catalyst changed dramatically. Unlike in the original game, Faith cannot use guns. She can fight in hand-to-hand combat but usually has to avoid enemies.</p>\n<h3>Style</h3>\n<p>Like its predecessor, Catalyst is notable for its minimalist use of colors. Glass is mostly shining white and dark blue, while the occasional use of other colors signifies something important. The game is accompanied by the cold, atmospheric electronic soundtrack by Solar Fields.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Risk of Rain 2 is a 3D roguelite sci-fi third-person shooter developed by Hopoo Games and published by Gearbox Publishing. Hopoo Games is composed of Paul Morse, Duncan Drummond and Jeffrey Hunt. The game released in early access during March of 2019 after it was showcased at PAX East. It is the sequel to the 2013 2D action platformer roguelite, Risk of Rain.</p>\n<p>Similarly to the first game, the player must fight their way through a sequence of stages where they&#39;ll find a variety of randomly placed items to improve their abilities until they become immensely powerful. However, difficulty increases with time and death is permanent. They can choose from a number of playable characters and unlock new items and classes through various achievements. They can learn more about the lore of the game by collecting logs regarding enemies, items or locations. </p>\n<p>Unlike the first game which was a 2D sidescroller, Risk of Rain 2 is a fully 3D third-person shooter, a rarely seen transition in the last decade. The game received praise for managing to keep the same feel as the first game and taking advantage of the transition to improve it further. This sequel includes both new and returning items and playable characters, new locations and all new mechanics, such as Lunar items, special items with powerful effects and major drawbacks to counterbalance them.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing, Risk of Rain 2 is still in early access. Information featured on this page may change in the future.</p>"

He has no past, as he is a clone created by a mad scientist. In the beginning, 47 is being held in a mental hospital, before he escapes to become a killer for hire. His job is to eliminate high-ranking mafia bosses for large sums of money while attracting as little attention as possible. His missions may initially seem unrelated, but the plot eventually ties everything together.</p>\n<p>Hitman has to use precise timing, unconventional tactics, and stealth skills to get to his targets and neutralize their bodyguards. He can attack from behind, use sniper&#39;s rifles, machine guns, or even improvised weapons, such as a halter. There are usually many ways to accomplish every murder. An important part of the gameplay is disguise: Hitman can attack people and steal their clothes to blend into any environment. Dead or unconscious bodies of Hitman&#39;s victims can be dragged away and hidden to avoid raising an alert. Money earned from previous missions can be used to buy additional killing equipment. Hitman may also lose a part of his reward if he kills civilians on a mission.</p>"

The townspeople are struck by a mutation that turns people into bloodthirsty monsters.</p>\n<p>The protagonist of the game is a seemingly unremarkable young man named Alex Mercer. At the beginning of the game, we know little about him, but it&#39;s still more than he knows about himself - Alex does not remember anything, does not even know that he has super abilities.</p>\n<p>Abilities are very useful to him, because he will have to stop the epidemic and at the same time hide from the army, police and mercenaries.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Alex comes to the senses in Ghentec&#39;s morgue, located in its Manhattan headquarters. Apparently, the reason for his awakening was the noise produced by mercenaries of the organization Blackwatch, trying to break open the doors of this headquarters.</p>\n<p>Alex tries to hide, run away. The mercenaries try to stop him, but Alex discovers in himself one by one amazing abilities - he is not harmed by bullets, he can jump high, throw heavy objects, run on the walls of buildings. And he can &quot;absorb&quot; people, taking their appearance and gaining knowledge about everything that the absorbed people know and remember. For example, after the takeover of one of the commanders of Blackwatch, Alex finds out that he has a sister.</p>\n<p>Alex finds his sister and learns from her (this time without absorption) that he was an important employee of the company, at the headquarters of which we met him at the beginning of the game. Alex&#39;s job duties included working with biological weapons.</p>\n<p>During the game, the army and the police consider Alex guilty of creating and spreading the virus, Blackwatch pursues Alex for other reasons, and Alex himself tries to stop the mutants and other opponents with all the power of their super abilities. Soon it turns out that among these superpowers there is the ability to turn his body into almost anything, including weapons, shield and armor.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>All of Manhattan from the very beginning of the game is open for the game. Outside of Manhattan, however, you can not get out. The player can follow the story, and can perform separate missions. Due to the presence of super abilities, the hero can move both horizontally and on walls. But not as an insect, but just running. Falling from the height does not hurt Alex, so he can use this trick to defeat opponents - literally falling on their heads.<br />\n<br />\nAlex can jump very high, and manage to plan in the air.</p>\n<p>Alex fights, using the ability of his body to transform. His hands can turn into sledgehammers, blades, whips or shields. He can instantly increase the volume of his body&#39;s muscles to increase their strength - in normal mode, such a mass would have prevented him, so he does not wear all these muscles all the time. His skin can be turned into armor. He can also see in the dark and distinguish mutants from normal people by eyes.</p>\n<p>All abilities can also be improved as you progress in the game and perform various tasks.</p>\n<p>In addition to the super powers of the body, the hero uses assault rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, captures infantry combat vehicles, tanks, helicopters and uses their weapons.</p>"

Although Episodes from LC is not a direct sequel to the series, it is slightly connected with the original GTA IV. Despite having the same game setting as in the previous GTA chapter (the action takes place in Liberty City approximately at the same time), the city itself faces some cosmetic changes. Several new details (new vehicles, weaponry and mini-games) were also added to the gameplay. The game also has better graphics and optimization. Episodes gives players an opportunity to dive into the atmosphere of crime, which Liberty City is famous for. The game includes two separate storylines: The Lost and Damned, and The Ballad of Gay Tony. In The Lost and Damned players take control of Johnny, a member of brutal biker gang The Lost, who has to fight against rival gangs for control of a city. Ballad of Gay Tony experiences playing for Luis Lopez, who tries to find himself in the world full of violence and obscenity.</p>"

It is also the earliest game in the Fallout universe inner chronology, thus serving as a prequel to the whole series.</p>\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n<p>The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, a quarter century after a nuclear holocaust that turned most of the US into a radioactive wasteland. The players assume the roles of the various dwellers of Vault 76, presumably the first Vault-Tec bunker to release its inhabitants. Their goal is to reclaim the world. The vault is located in the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia. Fallout 76 offers an open world with many locations based on real West Virginia places. Some of the new monsters are also based on the local folklore.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Unlike all previous games in its series, Fallout 76 features no human NPCs (although robots and monsters are present). Instead, the game delivers the story through records and environment. Some of Fallout series famous mechanics return in Fallout 76. The character creation is based on a modified version of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system of abilities and perks. V.A.T.S. targeting system also appears, albeit this time it works in real-time. The game allows the players to build homes and establish settlements in any part of the map. There are also nuclear missiles that allow the players to annihilate each other&#39;s settlements.</p>"

Yarni moves around the house, goes into the yard, examines the neighborhood. It is small and therefore a mug, flower bed or children&#39;s bicycle are obstacles in its way. But the yarn that Yarni is made of is subject to him, he can catch on to the object, pull himself up and climb up, swing and jump, maybe even pull yarn and walk along it like a tightrope walker. The variety of these techniques is large enough, tips help to use them. You can interact with all objects, sometimes there are creatures that can block the path - for example, insects.<br />\nYarn can not be unrolled indefinitely, it is necessary to monitor its consumption. Sometimes you can return the unwound yarn back to the &quot;body&quot;, sometimes you can increase the amount of yarn, finding a new piece.<br />\nThe most valuable thing Yarni finds is memories. Memories of a family of people, from which he &quot;comes&quot; himself. Memories are painted with different emotions, a sufficient number of collected memories opens the entrance to the following levels. In the game there are two lines of events. Events of the past arise as memories, they are found by Yarni. At the same time, the Yarni journey goes in the present - and also serves as a source of events that make up not the past but the present.</p>"

You get a letter from a boy named Ethan Carter, who cries out for help. You have nothing to do but go to his town and find out what happens to Ethan\u2019s family.<br />\nThe game is focused on puzzle solving and exploration, and set in an open world environment. The superpowers you obtain make your investigation easier: you can sense where hidden objects are and restore the circumstances of the crimes you reveal.<br />\nAs a rule, the game shows you the path (literally and figuratively), but any derogations add details to the atmosphere of the game. So you can freely explore locations, read numerous notes and learn more about the inhabitants of the town you came to. On the other hand, you can follow the main line directly, and it won&#39;t be spoiled by the lack of details. In the end, the game becomes something between an interactive drama and a detective quest.</p>"

Plotwise, it is the series&#39; spin-off rather than the sequel.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game is set in the world after the literal Biblical Apocalypse that involved the Four Horsemen and a battle between angels and demons. The story of Darksiders III unfolds at the background of the events of two original games. Darksiders III follows Fury, a Horsewoman of the Apocalypse and the sister to the original protagonist, War the Horseman. She goes on a quest given to her by the Charred Council, an institution that is meant to keep the balance between Heaven, Hell, and Earth. Fury&#39;s mission is to find and annihilate the infamous Seven Deadly Sins. The mighty Lord of the Hollows agrees to help her, although he&#39;s obviously pursuing his own goals. He gives Fury the power of the flame.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Fury from the third person view in an open world. She can use a variety of weapons, including a whip, a sword, and a dagger, as well as her magical abilities. She can also shape-shift into several forms based on elements, such as the flame. Fury also has to solve puzzles and jump platforms. The game reintroduces some of the enemies from the previous parts and introduces new monsters. The enemies in Darksiders III are less numerous but stronger and tougher, taking more effort to beat them.</p>"

It takes place in the fictional Empire inspired by the XIX-century England. The plot picks up where Dishonored 2 left it. The game follows the adventures of the previous games&#39; villains: Billie Lurk, the captain of a sailing ship, and Daud, the assassin and the leader of The Whalers gang. They search for Outsider, an extradimensional creature from the world known as the Void who can give people supernatural abilities, and are going to kill him. Their story is intertwined with the larger events in the Empire, such as the reinstallment of the Empress, the faction rivalry and the Void influence on the world. The plot is non-linear and features multiple endings.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Billie Lurk from the first person view. Like its predecessors, Death of the Outsider emphasizes stealth and surprise attacks. Billie wields a dagger and eventually receives superhuman powers, such as teleportation and disguise. The expansion allows the unusually free use of these abilities. The player doesn&#39;t have to unlock them, they become available early at the game, and the energy they require regenerates automatically over time. Besides the main plot, the player can also accept side quests.</p>"

The main characters are homeowners who, with the help of plants, protect their garden from the invasion of zombies. The game was ported to all kinds of consoles, including mobile platforms.</p>\n<p>In Plants vs. Zombies player places on the playing field of tower-plants, which automatically bombard attacking zombies. The main goal is not to let the undead get to the house. The towers are distinguished by their effectiveness against a certain type of enemies and the attack modes. </p>\n<p>The game has several modes: in addition to the usual singleplayer campaign, Adventure Mode is available where a player can earn currency for in-game upgrades. The battle layout also changes throughout the game: it starts on a simple backyard and advances into more complicated night levels and etc.</p>\n<p>The game has a lot of references to the works of popular culture: for example, inscriptions on tombstones are taken from Monty Python&#39;s  &quot;Dead Parrot sketch&quot;.</p>"

        "description": "<p>MIND CONTROL DELETE is a standalone expansion set in the SUPERHOT universe. It\u2019s designed as a rogue-like twist on the linear nature of the original SUPERHOT. In it\u2019s well proven genre-defining format, SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE distills and expands on the same intoxicating rhythm of slow motion combat.<br />\nThe game will force you through dozens of increasingly difficult time-moves-only-when-you-move gameplay challenges. Each challenge will make you more powerful and bring you closer to deciphering the secrets hidden from you by the system. As you unlock powerful abilities and gain access to new playable characters, so will your enemies grow stronger, smarter and more desperate to stop you.<br />\nCome and join the fray. Play in Early Access. Let the system learn from you.SUPERHOT rogue-like expansion early access hype! What to expect now?<br />\nWe\u2019re still a good 9-12 months away from a full release, so please don\u2019t forget that this is nowhere close to a complete, satisfying experience just yet. The current build of MIND CONTROL DELETE is the first time we\u2019re inviting you to check out a few of the brand new gameplay systems that are going to be central to the game:<br />\nFirst 2 playable MINDS, each with it\u2019s own unique ability and gameplay modifiers<br />\nA kaleidoscope of the first dozen new gameplay levels that mix into the first few dozen combat challenges<br />\nNew animation and AI systems to drive new weapons, abilities, and enemy types<br />\nHitpoint system and power-up store to give you that extra oompf needed to crush your enemies and see them driven before you<br />\nProcedural rogue-like run generation baked into the core gameplay loop, enabling us to tell longer, more complex stories and deliver tons more of satisfying skill-based gameplay<br />\nBeware though - this is an extremely early, bleeding-edge version of most of those systems. The limitations for this early access build are not for the faint of heart:<br />\nNo story whatsoever - we don\u2019t want to spoil too much too quickly so this and the next few updates will be all about gameplay features<br />\nNo advanced power-ups or new enemy types enabled yet - we want to establish and test the balance of vanilla gameplay in this build, waiting to sprinkle in gamebreaking modifiers and new foes to beat up until future updates<br />\nNo replay or point system - easy bragging about your insane skills will need to wait<br />\nAbsolutely no hidden menu minigames yet - we have so many new cool ones coming out super soon tho &lt;3<br />\nIf you\u2019re not looking for an incomplete game that\u2019s in constant flux and relies on your feedback and creativity to expand, or if you\u2019d rather just play a finished experience that\u2019s guaranteed to challenge and satisfy you and your deepest power fantasies, then we totally recommend you should wait until MIND CONTROL DELETE is out of early access.<br />\nHowever, if you\u2019re super brave and want to help guide the development in its earliest stages, then go ahead - join us, and get your name in the credits!Why are you putting MIND CONTROL DELETE in early access in the first place tho?<br />\nWe released the original SUPERHOT in February 2016 after nearly two years of intense creative crunch. The amazing support during the development from our Kickstarter backers and the exhilarating reaction we got from you once the game released was simply mind blowing.<br />\nWith morale at an all-time high, we immediately jumped into a flurry of prototyping and refining gameplay and story concepts that we weren\u2019t able to fit into the original game. We tested and put a bunch of them to work in virtual reality, and after releasing SUPERHOT VR to even more outstanding support from you guys, we finally had a road map for the first non-VR expansion ironed out in December 2016. In our usual no-compromise approach to design, we made that roadmap way more ambitious than originally anticipated and we decided to make the expansion a fully standalone game, allowing us to rewrite and reimagine all of our major gameplay systems.<br />\nThe single most important strength of the original SUPERHOT was the amazing involvement of tens of thousands of creative alpha and beta testers that helped us shape and balance the game and drove us to pursue zero compromises in design. After over a year of work on MIND CONTROL DELETE, we\u2019re now ready to start this adventure together again. We\u2019re inviting you to jump in and co-create the game with us. Talk to us, work with us, and let\u2019s build the build the biggest SUPERHOT yet together.What\u2019s the price tag on this? Is this that free DLC you were talking about?<br />\nYup! Way bigger than the usual free DLC though, so it&#39;ll take a bit longer to release. If you own the original SUPERHOT on Steam now or buy it while MIND CONTROL DELETE is still in Early Access, you\u2019ll get the full expansion for free once it\u2019s finished and released.<br />\nHowever if you can\u2019t wait to work with us, and you feel like bravely facing rough edges and helping shape the game as it develops, then we\u2019ll be thrilled to have you sign your name to a piece of SUPERHOT history and join us in Early Access right now.<br />\nOnce MIND CONTROL DELETE releases in earnest, it will be priced same as the other SUPERHOT games for everyone who\u2019s still new to the franchise.FAQ<br />\nShould I buy MIND CONTROL DELETE if I haven\u2019t played the original SUPERHOT?<br />\nNot right now. The game will be a totally standalone experience in a few updates, but the lack of clear structure and story right now would be confusing for newcomers. Definitely get the original SUPERHOT though. It\u2019s lots of fun.<br />\nWhat\u2019s the update roadmap?<br />\nWe\u2019re new to Early Access, but we\u2019re hoping to use your feedback and collaboration to drive and guide the development. We have a bunch of large features already in the pipeline that we\u2019ll be dropping on livestream updates every few weeks, starting with the first major content update dropping in January, and following with balance and feature updates released on a monthly / bi-monthly schedule.<br />\nI really want X in the game, how do I make you want to do X too?<br />\nThe discussions around the game are taking place on Steam Community, Discord and Reddit groups. Join us, make yourself heard, and rally up your fellow players. We\u2019ll tap into your creative hivemind. We\u2019ll put your ideas into life.<br />\nYour mind will make the system stronger. You will be ONE OF US.</p>"

        "description": "<p>This sequel to the comic dark fantasy Overlord allows the player to have fun being evil. You play as the dark Overlord who leads his armies of minions against the human Glorious Empire (which obviously mimics the real-world Roman Empire). The Glorious Empire is not &quot;good&quot; anyway: its leaders are trying to eliminate all magic users, so the &quot;evil&quot; motivation is quite justified. However, to accomplish his conquest and become a truly powerful and feared dark lord, you will have to commit some really vile deeds. One of your first missions, for example, involves slaughtering baby seals.<br />\nThe game follows the Overlord from his childhood, as he grows from a nasty kid to a mighty dark knight that looks a lot like Sauron as shown in The Fellowship of the Ring movie. The Overlord begins his conquest with a pack of goblins and a single troll, but over time his minions will develop into more powerful and deadly creatures and attack the enemy in large hordes. The game does not turn into a strategy, however, as you still only directly control the dark lord himself, and the minions are commanded through his orders.  Overlord II is famous for its humor: the game does not take itself too seriously. There are all sorts of puns and parodies on the stereotypical villains and other fantasy tropes, such as elves and fairies. Goblin minions squeak, cringe and fall, while playful Danny-Elfman-esque music is echoing in the background.</p>"

It is the first game in the series to feature MMO-kind of gameplay, where every players&#39; action affects the plot of the games universe. This is the fourth installment in the Elite video games series and it&#39;s the sequel to Frontier: First Encounters. This is one of those successful Kickstarter campaigns which launched in 2012. The pre-released version of Elite Dangerous was available since December 2013 and after one long year it was finally released as a full game on Microsoft Windows. In 2015 it was released on OS X and Xbox One and one year later  - on PlayStation 4. The game also supports VR devices including HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.<br />\nElite Dangerous is set in a year 3304. Its premise, as with the other games in the series, is to start as a small ship with a small amount of money and then with measures of trading, mining, bounty-hunting, piracy and assassination to go up your career. <br />\nThere are three different factions in the game including Empire of Achenar, the Galactic Federation, and the Alliance of Independent Systems and four player status levels (combat, CQC Championship, exploration and trading).</p>"

The year is 2145, and the technological progress has allowed humanity to set up different facilities on Mars. After an experiment goes wrong, the research center becomes inhabited by demons. The player controls a nameless space marine, fighting off hordes of enemies through a variety of levels. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The playable character employs a large arsenal of weaponry for his cause, from common firearms to the series\u2019s trademark BFG9000. Each level of the game is linear, as the player must often either retrieve information, some device or reach the checkpoint. However, there are numerous obstacles on the way to the objective: the protagonist has to fight off not only demons and their servants, but also combat the natural enemy in the form of darkness. </p>\n<h3>Graphics and music</h3>\n<p>The engine of the game incorporates lighting and shadowing, making every object in the game feel real and natural. The textures are designed to be unappealing, as a psychological tool to ensure the player\u2019s urge to get rid of the enemies and escape the dark and ruined corridors, but at the same time, the level of detail in each location and each enemy is very high.</p>"

Sure, why not. Want to see a company of WW2 U.S soldiers fight 11,000 Medieval soldiers?? There are simply no limits to the carnage you can achieve in Epic Battle Simulator. Mess around with a massive variety of units. Everything from, Roman Centurions, Medieval soldiers, Knights, Orcs, Trolls, and yes, chickens! The main focus in this game is giving the player no restrictions to what he can do. That is why we decided not to limit the amount of units in battle. Want to see what a battle of 100,000 units looks like? We don't recommend going past 10,000 for most machines but its your CPU, do what you want! On top of that, you can play as any one of the units in the game, getting up close and personal to help change the tides of a massive battle, while rallying teammates and giving them orders!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Technology:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUnfortunately there really aren't many engines that you can chuck 10,000 characters in and expect good performance. This is why I worked months on end to create the most powerful crowd rendering system ever conceived in Unity engine. The detail of each character has little effect on performance while each individual acts independently, but is working towards a greater good for his team.  Each individual decides his own path and navigates complex environments. But I didn't stop there! With the large open environments, I needed a more dynamic lighting solution than the one built in to Unity engine. So I built my own dynamic global illumination lighting engine. This enables bounce light completely in real time. What does that mean? That means every piece of shiny armor is reflecting it's true surroundings, every bright surfaces illuminates it's surroundings and effects the overall lighting. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYes I worked hard to bring this game to life, may you all inflict carnage upon it!"

The game was developed by the Japanese studio Team Ninja for the Sony PlayStation 4 console and PC in 2017. The development team previously released projects such as Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive. The version of the game for the PC contains all the additional content that came out on the console.</p>\n<h3>The setting</h3>\n<p>The game takes place in the seventeenth century Japan, in the fictionalized version of the Sengoku period, when the country was engulfed in the flames of civil war. The player takes control of the An Anglo-Irish sailor named William, who sets out in pursuit of the villain in the country of the rising sun and finds himself entangled in the mystical and political upheavals that pervaded all of Japan. Despite the fantasy elements, the plot uses real prototypes of historical events and personalities.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The controls are quite simple: two types of attack, block and dodge are available. The gameplay is modified by role-playing elements: for example, at the start of the game, it is necessary to choose which weapon in William will be predefined. This helps to determine which skills to develop, with further completion. Like Dark Souls, enemies are reborn after each interaction with the local analog of bonfires - Shrines.</p>"

        "description": "<p>No More Room in Hell is a co-op first person video game with elements of survival horror. The game is created by only one person - Matt \u201cMax\u201d Kazan. It was made as a modification on Valve Corporation\u2019s Source engine. <br />\nThe game tells a story about zombie apocalypse. The player gets a role of one of eight survivors. The game is said to be inspired by classic George Romero\u2019s Living Dead films series as well as Dawn of the Dead, American Psycho and The Big Lebowski films. <br />\nAt first, the game was released only as a mod for Half-Life 2 but later it was released as standalone title on October 31, 2013. No More Room in Hell was developed since 2004. It has two game modes \u2013 Objective and Survival. In Objective mode the player must accomplish given objectives and finally escape the map alive. With every new playthrough objectives on the man changes in a favor of replayability of the game. In Survival mode players have to protect certain areas from waves of zombies, each wave becoming more and more difficult. The player has to protect those areas until the helicopter arrives and takes them back to safety.</p>"
